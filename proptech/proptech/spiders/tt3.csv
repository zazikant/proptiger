With the replacement of AutoCAD drafting with BIM, designers can now create 1:1 scale virtual models of buildings. One of the most powerful aspects of our custom 3D modeling service is that designers can create floor plans, sections and elevations by taking snapshots from different perspectives. This was not possible previously when building plans used to be created in CAD software. Using Revit BIM modeling, it is possible to create color fill, 3D perspective, detailed drawing, and rendering limited walkthrough animation.  Our 3D model outsourcing services aim at bringing coordination and collaboration between various disciplines of architectural, structural and MEP; and increase accuracy in design decisions. We deliver clash-free 3D Revit modeling services for building plans to help contractors avoid rework and save cost and time. If there is a change to any element, it would automatically propagate to keep the model consistent. For example, a change is made to the location of a wall, it would update the adjacent walls, roofs, floors, adjust the floor areas reported in schedules, redraw section views and correct the placement and values of dimensions and notes. As a result, we can get all the documentation coordinated even after the change. Our Revit BIM service We offer quality Revit BIM services at reasonable prices in multiple disciplines like structural, architectural and MEP BIM services. Our skilled professional team develops a 3D Revit BIM model based on interior elevations, details, floor plans and sections provided by the clients into a BIM model. We use Revit Families Creation for architectural objects like windows, walls, doors, cabinetry, furniture, etc. The custom families that we create, match the unique building systems, furniture, and equipment of clients. Flexibility to Expand We have the flexibility to expand the existing Revit architectural background to include mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment or rotate it in various directions to view the different perspectives of the building. This helps to identify and avoid conflicts between different building systems.

A drawing or a set of drawings, which are required for prefabricated components like trusses, elevators, structural steel, windows, cabinets, appliances, mill-work, and air handling units and produced by the contractor, supplier, manufacturer, fabricator, or sub-contractors, are called shop drawings. An MEP HVAC shop drawing is the drawn version of the information in theconstruction documents. It includes dimensions, manufacturing standards, fabricationand contains more details compared to construction documents. An MEP shop drawingthat emphasizes a particular product or installation has a very different style from that of the architects drawing.  CoordinatedMEP shop drawings provide support for design-build projects in various areas like: Electrical component technical drawings Composite drawings Underground and above-ceiling coordination Coordinated shop drawings Sheet metal drawings Pipe fabrication drawings HVAC shop drawings Duct shop drawings Plumbing construction shop drawings Fabrication Drawing Plumbing Shop Drawing Mechanical piping detail drawings Mechanical room HVAC detailed drawings Equipment Placement Why Use MEP Coordinated Shop Drawings? Using Revit family creation services, many more items like curtain wall panels, ceilings, furniture, fixtures, counters, plumbing fixtures, electrical fixtures, machine parts, elevators, insulators, and HVAC pumps can be created. The MEP coordinated shop drawings that include HVAC, electrical, plumbing, piping, andduct-work layout drawings, enable engineers to create better fabrication drawings, installation, schedule trades, and other activities related to construction. These drawings ensure that each contractor gets a place for his system which needs to be installed in a structure. It allows extraction and manipulation of data for trades and contributors and increases the accuracy of the building design and delivery process. It enhances building quality and productivity through improved off-site fabrication, enhanced plans, and better-informed trade crews. Potential problems are identified before fabrication and installation on the job site. It enables to view the building project as a whole than as a separate drawing. It provides the client cost savings of around 50% and improvements in delivery schedules of over 40%. > Ready to adopt and benefit from BIM, with Excelize?

There are many benefits of visualizing an AEC project as if it were constructed. It provides a glimpse into the future of the clients throughBIM Modeling services. Visualization helps review the concept and design objectives. It can act as a communication tool for the contractor and the consultant. Visualization is relevant in a project lifecycle, from the very beginning to the very end. Visualization has a crucial role in BIM, as it is an effective communication tool for various BIM stakeholder groups. At first, the client gets an idea of what he will get for his money. Besides, the client can make a good selection during the project and ensure that the critical path of the project is understood. As a result, the firm can deliver the project on time, within budget and with minimal issues. Therefore, the construction firms try to implement visualization tactics in all phases of a project and to involve all parties in using it. The benefits of BIM are varied for each one in the construction industry. While it is an advanced computer-aided design for someone, others find it as a series of models for distinct elements of a project. Using BIM, designers explore alternative concepts, optimize their designs and conduct value engineering. > Ready to adopt and benefit from BIM, with Excelize?

We leverage the potential of point cloud technology by integrating it with our BIM expertise. Point cloud is a set of data points in a 3D coordinate system representing the external surface of a building. The 3D scanned data captures every single detail, thus eliminating the need for repeated site visits. Our experts create BIM models from the point cloud. Point cloud scan to BIM is used nowadays by a number of sectors including retailers, main contractors, and architects. It is also used by MEP designers, MEP contractors, and consulting engineers. The main advantage of Scan to BIM is its ability to analyze the differences between point cloud and model geometry by creating native Revit geometry from and to a point cloud. Using scan to BIM model, data can be exported or imported in a format understandable by electronic surveying equipment that will enable you to read the survey data for as-built conditions and to export design data for field verification. Main Application of Scan to BIM Services Scan to BIM helps createas-built BIM Modelingfor retrofit, refurbishment and renovation projects. It enables the creation of as-built BIM models for the renovation work of infrastructure assets such as tunnels and bridges. It is used to create as-built BIM models for MEP services that help the managers provide early clash detection alerts. It enhances the creation of an intelligentBIM model in Revitby providing accurate point cloud data to the clients. It helps measure points within the scan to find true dimensions quickly. Why choose Excelize? We convert point cloud data into information-rich BIM models from laser surveyed data images and point clouds.

Using BIG rooms and 3D BIM models, different stakeholders on the project coordinately with efficiency and speed. There is no need for the team members to be present physically at one location. BIM and VDC are closely related, but they are not the same. BIM involves building virtually an object (like a structure) with associated information. VDC, on the other hand, uses BIM models to plan the building process from start to finish.  The 4D and 5D model as a VDC coordination platform Implementation of BIM during preconstruction phase is widely accepted. Using the intelligent BIM model during construction will benefit the project directly. This is where we see virtual construction, monitoring, and planning procedures. The 4th Dimension or 4D in BIM is the component of time. By linking a project plan with the 3D model construction can be simulated. We can identify challenges, track planned and actual construction progress amongst other things. This is a BIG benefit of BIM for Virtual construction. Project planning team has the ability to identify, resolve virtually any issue and thus avoid time delays and material wastages due to rework upfront. Every change at design or construction stage impacts the cost of the project. With 5D BIM, the impact of change in design can be very quickly calculated. When we link the 3D BIM model and the quantities extracted from the model with the cost information, we have a single source of truth to get the most accurate information. As the take-offs and measurements are directly calculated from the BIM model, the information stays consistent throughout the project lifecycle. Digital twin A virtual replica of the physical structure is called a Digital Twin. The digital twin will be geo located and can thus be integrated into a virtual 3D city model. Using IoT enabled devised the physical twin/building transmits real-time data to the virtual twin. Using the virtual twin, building performance is optimized during the building's lifecycle and this, in turn, is seen in the physical building. Conclusion Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) essentially creates a digital twin, builds the entire project virtually (digitally) before it is built in the real world. This process starts are pre-construction stage, runs through the construction stage, and is an important aspect during the maintenance and operation of the structure. This process allows to reduce the risk, eliminate conflicts, and reduce the cost of the project. VDC focuses on planning the construction of the BIM model and includes elements such as budget, cost estimation, and scheduling, also called BIM 4D and 5D. BIM is the key technology used in this process. > Ready to adopt and benefit from BIM, with Excelize?

We pioneered the concepts of the Offshore Working Model, the Dedicated Studio Model, and most recently, the Hybrid (onshore + offshore) Model. Let us trace our evolution from the time we began operations as an architectural firm in 2004. At the time, we provided CAD draftingand design management services to clients in the US and in India. This was the traditional working model where the majority of the work then was outsourced from the U.S. This was called the Offshore Working Model. We soon developed a robust mechanism to deliver outsourced design documentation works in AutoCAD and BIM in line with international standards.  Figure 1.0 Offshore working model After more than a decade of experience in providing CAD andBIM services to global clients, we realized that clients kept coming back to us for repeat orders. In order to stay in tune with the changing needs of the industry, we created a key relationship management team that was completely dedicated to meeting the requirements of our marquee clients. Thus, the Dedicated Studio Working Model or BIMStaff Augmentationcame into existence. Figure 2.0 Dedicated Studio Working Model The current model which finds its roots in the offshore working model contains an added element of onsite support to the client. Excelize extended its resource support to clients territory of work by sending a BIM project manager to clients overseas sites or offices. This is the new model  Onshore + Offshore Working Model (Hybrid). Our years of experience in outsourcing and managing dedicated clients helped pioneer this effective and path-breaking concept of onshore plus offshore working model. It has proven to be the most effective way to manage outsourced projects. Benefits of Hybrid Working Model Due to the availability of an onsite BIM project manager during clients working hours, the communication is quick and effective and it helps: Addressing issues as soon as they surface on site. Helps the onsite team to coordinate and raise Request for Information (RFI) and respond to RFIs from subcontractors. The on-site BIM project manager is part of the clients team and shares a good interpersonal relationship with the client so he is able to: Solve complex structure constructability issues with BIM-enabled drawings. Resolve issues during construction or service installation. The project managers proficiency in handling the BIM model helps the client and all stakeholders to understand complex designs in 3D, planning logistics on-site, maintain project schedules via 4D BIM. His technical expertise and high standards of quality help reduce costs and provide a quicker turnaround on projects. > Ready to adopt and benefit from BIM, with Excelize?

While BIM modeling is an invaluable tool for efficient construction, it is the BIM coordination services that bring it all together. As we know, BIM 3D, 4D, and 5D modeling software are used to visualize architectural models, to detect any clashes in the model, to estimate the bills of quantity as well the cost of the project and are thereby able to reduce cost and time inefficiencies during the pre-construction period itself. Our BIM coordination services bring together all the different renderings of the project and create a collaborative clash-free visualization of the design. BIM coordination enhances the purpose and operability of the BIM modeling software and ensures that projects do not get delayed and or incur unnecessary expenses for the construction team as well as clients. BIM coordination focuses on light areas of concern, disparity, and unevenness in the design in a way that accelerates the planning and development process and thereby enhances production value. BIM coordination services process-map Typical steps followed in our BIM coordination services are: Data collection: All the essential data including inputs and specifications are collected from clients. Idea development: A brainstorming session, in which the data provided by the client is thoroughly examined, throws up creative ideas to launch the project in a user-friendly manner.

Adoption of this digital technology is growing in India and many countries like the UK and Germany are mandating the use of BIM for public infrastructure projects. Several known challenges in the traditional construction methods can be minimized or completely eradicated with the use of BIM. Its not only the industry but also the academia that has taken a keen interest in the application and implementation of BIM in civil engineering, architecture, project management, operations, and facilities management. I believe that the effective use of BIM can help in increasing the efficiency of our construction industry. Its a widely accepted stat that a construction project takes roughly 20% longer than the initially estimated time to complete and is approximately 80% over budget. A potentBIM implementationcan play a crucial role in controlling these time and project costs. BIM is mostly considered as3D modelingsoftware, but in reality, it's far more than that. The seven dimensions of BIM allow us to add focus on time, cost, as-built, and sustainability. The technology helps in rectifying errors, controlling costs, efficient planning, and better operations management of a facility. This means that, apart from improving construction operations, it could play a key role in defining a sustainable and competitive construction strategy as well. Benefits of Integrating BIM in Construction Strategy The role of BIM in construction strategy is often debated. BIM can be considered as an extended version of the project manager in a construction project. BIM helps in integrating the different aspects of a construction project through effective communication. It can validate the design for constructability by building a visual picture. And, it can help, estimate accurate project costs and times. The seamless collaboration between the various teams is an added benefit. The BIM model considers the entire lifecycle of a facility from design to operations along with all the required information. The virtual model of the actual facility provides an insight into the physical and logistical characteristics of the facility. The digital prototype plays a significant role in meeting the design shortcomings before the construction begins, thereby reducing the time lag occurring due to redesigning or rework during the construction phase. Lets look into some significant benefits of integrating BIM into the construction strategy: 1.Effective communication and team building More often than not, lack of effective communication amongst the involved parties causes errors that result in increased costs and delays in a construction project. In the absence of BIM, the interested parties work independently to achieve exclusive goals from the project. BIM unifies and integrates the architects, engineers, operations and systems management, and project management into a collaborative process. The collaboration leads to a unified and common goal definition right at the planning stage, thereby improving the chances of all the teams being aligned at each phase of construction. 2.Cost and time estimation Time and cost are two major factors attributing to the success of a construction project. BIM model helps in estimating costs and the time required during the designing and planning phase. The model-based cost and time estimation helps in eliminating human error by providing the most accurate numbers. Getting a reliable estimate of these parameters at the construction planning stage can significantly ramp up the effectiveness of the financing and planning function and in the case of commercial real estate projects helps in driving sales. 3.Eliminating on-site redesigning and rework The final constructed building is often quite different than its first blueprint. Every design undergoes numerous changes before the construction begins. The digital prototype of the facility provides a real-time view of the building. The visualization of the final design in the preconstruction phase allows the involved parties to analyse the constructability of the design. Without BIM, these changes are observed during the construction phase, and time is lost while reworking the design. The BIM model helps in eliminating such situations. Having an accurate picture of the facility as it is, rather than imagining the design can help drive expansion and future redevelopment strategies. 4.Cost reduction with material quantities Calculating quantities of the raw material is crucial in any construction project. Traditionally, the consultants estimate the quantity with the help of2D drawingsand thumb rules, which often results in over or under-estimation. Thequantity take-offswith BIM are far more accurate and precise, which helps in reducing costs due to wastage or lack of raw materials. Being able to procure materials with confidence can help the procurement teams get better deals and assure a more predictable supply of materials over the duration of the project. 5.Building handover and operations management The most important thing during handing over of a building is the building information which plays an essential role in the operations management of the facility. The digitally centralized information in the BIM model is easily accessible to the operations management team, unlike the traditional way where one needs to manage a bunch of files and papers making it challenging to access information during an emergency or crisis. This has strategic implications on issues like driving efficient energy usage, green practices, and safety management.  I guess the point Im making is that BIM has more to offer than just faster and more efficient construction. The benefits of integrating BIM into your construction strategy are aplenty. I hope that the widespread adoption of BIM technology will revolutionize the construction industry by raising the bar a notch higher for all of us.

In 2018 alone, the annual spending on construction worldwide was estimated to be aroundUSD 11.4 Trillion. While most disruptions in the actual construction operations have been through the inventions or progress made in mechanical equipment and raw materials, there is a growing role being played by technology and digital transformation in propelling the sector to newer heights. From modelling projects through interactive visualization to enabling workforce safety, technology is slowly (but surely) becoming an integral part of the construction sector. Now comes the question of what can the industry explore next with technology? We have handpicked two great options to explore further  Digital Twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). A digital twin involves the concept of having a digital representation of a physical object created with accurate data. This digital representation supports real-time visualization of any impact the object may have when acted upon by external influence like a physical force, mechanical or chemical or electronic stimulation, or any other forms of influence. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to devices, or small machines, connected to the internet which allows them to be managed, analysed, and subject to activities  mechanical or electronic, from remote locations. Weve said it often that Building Information Modelling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction industry and paved the way for transitioning from pen and paper drawings to more efficient computer-based modelling. Bringing Digital Twins and IoT to the mainstream in this area will enable even more exciting possibilities in building or project design. So, what are the possibilities, the construction sector must explore from trends like digital twins and IoT? Here are 4: Sustainable Project Planning Using data from IoT sensors in existing projects worldwide, engineers can study the feasibility of new projects under similar environmental conditions. They can model each layer of a building based on how factors such as temperature, pressure, wind, and humidity impact the layer, with the data sourced from sensors on buildings in similar environments. This will ensure sustainable project planning and realize long-term benefits for tenants or owners of the project. Predict Resource Requirements Studies have shown that on average,25%of productive time is wasted due to delays in resource handling and logistics. These delays often occur due to labour shortage, miscalculated time for material and equipment availability, and other factors that arise mainly due to improper planning. BIM helps optimize resource procurement and provisioning by enabling more precise predictions and estimates. With powerful digital twin technology, construction companies can further enhance the plan for optimum resource utilization. Based on data-driven models, engineers can create digital twins of projects to estimate the resources needed in terms of man, machine, and materials far in advance. This will also help in reducing the wastage of resources and ensure better logistics efficiency for intense demand scenarios. Quality & Compliance Assurance While BIM has allowed for efficient project planning in the construction sector, they have some limitations in assuring the quality assurance of a built structure or in stages during the construction. This is one area where IoT and digital twinning can make a difference though. By integrating the designed model with actual data captured by IoT sensors in the structure being constructed, it was possible to continuously analyze and monitor the progress of construction and ensure adherence to pre-defined standards. For example, an intelligent AI-enabled digital twinning platform could help in identifying cracks and intrusions in structures using image processing algorithms on data captured by IoT sensors. This information can be used to alert contractors and have them manually inspect the construction with experts. This will greatly enhance the quality and compliance of buildings and structures. Environmental and other physical compliance requirements can also be validated at every stage by modelling digital twins of the structure with real-time data generated by sensors. Workforce Safety Being a labour-intensive sector, the construction industry is also, unfortunately, known for being one of the most dangerous industries for the human workforce as the majority of the work involves labour in the open air and often on high rises. Digital twinning in co-ordination with IoT sensors on the building as well as in the form of wearables for workers can prove to be a huge safety aid in the workplace. Managers or supervisors can be alerted when employees work in a potentially dangerous site or when they are deployed for handling hazardous work materials. They can ensure that these workers have enough safety gear and access to safety procedures in the event of a mishap. This level of preparedness can prove to be the difference between life and death in dangerous scenarios often witnessed in large construction projects. The construction industry stands to benefit immensely from adopting emerging trends such as digital twin and IoT. The right knowledge and selection of technology can help businesses in this space leverage great power in this way. They can build better landmarks with sustainable techniques and improve the working conditions for thousands of workers who rely on the construction sector for their livelihood.

By inputting data such as building orientation, envelope properties, HVAC systems, and lighting, BIM tools can predict a building's energy performance accurately. This analysis allows stakeholders to evaluate design alternatives and energy-saving strategies before construction begins. As a result, architects and engineers can make informed decisions to optimize the building's energy performance and reduce its carbon footprint. BIM enables identifying energy-efficient solutions that may not be apparent in traditional 2D drawings, leading to greener and more sustainable building designs.  3. Waste Reduction and Material Efficiency: Construction and demolition waste significantly impacts the environment. BIM helps tackle this issue by promoting waste reduction and efficient material usage. With BIM's precise quantity take-offs and material tracking capabilities, project teams can accurately estimate the materials needed for construction. By avoiding over-ordering materials, construction waste is minimized, saving costs, and reducing the environmental impact. Moreover, BIM can facilitate using sustainable materials and construction methodologies, further promoting eco-friendly building practices. The optimization of material usage through BIM contributes to a more resource-efficient construction process, aligning with sustainable construction goals.  4. Life Cycle Assessment and Maintenance: Sustainability goes beyond the construction phase; it encompasses the entire life cycle of a building. BIM enables life cycle assessment, which evaluates a building's environmental impacts from construction to operation and eventual decommissioning. Stakeholders can make informed decisions about the building's sustainable performance by considering maintenance requirements, energy consumption, and end-of-life considerations. This information becomes invaluable for facility managers, who can use the BIM model to plan for ongoing maintenance, optimize building operations, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the facility.  5. Sustainable Site Planning and Design: BIM's 3D modeling capabilities aid in sustainable site planning and design. Architects and planners can analyze site orientation, solar exposure, and green space integration to maximize energy efficiency and minimize environmental disturbances. Project teams can explore design alternatives through BIM simulations and assess their impact on the surrounding environment. Sustainable site planning, enabled by BIM, results in buildings that harmonize with their surroundings and reduce their environmental footprint.  6. Streamlined LEED Certification Process: LEED, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is one of the most widely recognized green building certification programs worldwide. Developed and administered by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), LEED provides a framework for designing, constructing, and operating environmentally sustainable buildings. The certification system evaluates a building's performance across several categories, such as sustainable site development, energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design. By leveraging the capabilities of BIM, project teams can streamline LEED documentation and verification processes, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the certification journey. BIM's data-driven approach and visualization tools empower stakeholders to make informed decisions that contribute to achieving higher levels of LEED certification and, more importantly, creating environmentally responsible and sustainable buildings. As the world confronts pressing environmental challenges, integrating BIM for sustainability is imperative for the AEC industry. The adoption of BIM unleashes many benefits, from enhanced collaboration and communication to improved energy efficiency and waste reduction. By leveraging BIM's capabilities for environmentally conscious design, material optimization, and life cycle assessment, stakeholders can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient built environment. Embracing BIM integration benefits individual projects and represents a crucial step towards a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.

The traditional approach for construction projects consists of the appointment of a designer on one side, and the appointment of a contractor on the other side. The design-build procurement route changes the traditional sequence of work. It answers the client's wishes for a single point of responsibility in an attempt to reduce risks and overall costs. During the virtual design and construction phase, building information modeling (BIM) tools are integrated into design-build firms. The integration of BIM enhances proficiency in construction and project management. The involvement of design-build firms from start to finish of any construction project increases its efficiency even more through BIM implementation. Most of our clients in the US and in India are design-build contractors who require architectural BIM services, 3D modeling services, BIM cost estimating, CAD drafting services and CAD conversion services.

By working more collaboratively,design, construction and operation teams are able touse technology to capture and structure asset data at key stages during a project. As these technologies mature and evolve, it creates an opportunity for other professional groups to use data within, or linked to, BIM models. BIM offers rich opportunities for property professionals to use information throughout the property lifecycle. Implemented well,BIM provides a powerful digital resource that canimprove performance, promote better collaboration, encourage strategic planning, assist portfolio rationalization and acquisitions, and manages valuable asset data. Better Quality At Lower Cost The best time for real estate developers to implement BIM on projects is at the very start of the project. BIM is the only guide that helps increase transparency and creates an integrated design and construction process. This results in better quality buildings at lower cost and in a short time frame.

Every team working on a full-scale construction project, either public or private, knows the importance of completing and handing over the site on time. Anyone operating in the construction industry can vouch for the high pressure around sticking to the deadlines and minding the budget. None of the involved parties from builders, architects, labour, to management appreciate delays. But more often than not, unforeseen circumstances arise and mess with the deadlines. This is where the combination of ERP and BIM can play a role. If optimally used, construction companies can save on time and money by putting the project back on track with the help of ERP and BIM. What is ERP? In our context, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is business solution software that maps the various processes and workflows in the project, lists tasks and assigns responsibilities, and allows greater visibility and trackability at all times. In essence, it provides powerful analytics using data from various construction processes. It takes an army of people to make a successful enterprise and the construction industry is no different. Construction ERP integrates diverse software systems used by various teams into one comprehensive solution by pulling together all the relevant information and provides the construction/project managers with a set of insights and tools for driving the efficient execution of the project. In this perspective, the success of a construction project lies in efficient project planning and accurate data management. This can be achieved by integrating BIM models and the ERP management solution. Benefits of Integrating BIM and ERP The world is increasingly shifting towards the digital age and its clear that technology is going to play a critical role in the success of every industry, including construction. The companies that utilize technology to its optimum level will survive and thrive. Of course, this suggests that the traditional ways of working cannot find solutions for issues arising in the technological age. One of the biggest obstacles in this digital age is the management of the humongous volume and variety of data created at every step of a construction project. As you become dependent on digital means to drive efficiency then questions about data become important to consider. Is the data accurate? Is it relevant? Is it current? Is it useful to deliver insights? Are those insights actionable? What is the impact of those actions? And so on.  Integrating BIM and ERP allows integration of actions and controls through effective communication of information that is made available to everyone from a central location. Always-on access to updated data will enable managers to get transparency into the real state of the project and then assist with making profitable business decisions. Of course, theres much more to ERP and BIM integration than just collating data. Lets look at the other crucial benefits of integrating ERP and BIM in a construction project: 1. Financial Management Contractual work is the norm in the construction industry. Tender bids are issued for large-scale projects. Accurate estimates of material and labour are key in both situations. The BIM + ERP combo can be used to derive accurate estimations for every item in the BOM and for the effort involved in delivering the project too. These calculations are more precise and accurate. This helps achieve more profitable, predictable project resource planning. 2. Enabling Better Performance Communication is an essential factor in deciding the success of a construction project. The integration of BIM and ERP provides a centralized source of information for every person working on the project. It feeds into defined workflows so that the right people get the right info when needed. The updates are made and recorded in real-time, thereby eradicating errors due to the time lag in communication. What if scenarios can be analysed quickly along with its implication downstream This helps the people and teams deliver better and be accountable for their efforts. 3. Avoiding contractual conflicts The solution helps in avoiding contractual conflicts with the client. It does this by creating a baseline estimate and then keeping track of inventory, raw material requirement, workforce, finances, and budgets of the project against the estimates. The meticulous analysis of the construction facets leaves little to no room for misunderstanding and helps drive more timely interventions if deviations become inevitable. 4. Streamlining data across projects Handling multiple projects or multiple facets of a single project at a given time is bound to create confusion in communicating information and instruction within the organization. Going through data for numerous projects on excel sheets and various other software amongst different departments is a cumbersome task. The BIM + ERP solution streamlines this chaos into one centralized source that is accessible for every employee of the organization. It helps break down the chaos into smaller, more manageable tasks, and allows individuals and teams to address them better. 5. Increased efficiency and productivity A centralized source of information for everything from cost estimations, inventory management, human resources, project management to facility operational management helps to increase the efficiency of the project. Provisioning resources based on these accurate estimates ensures that there is less downtime due to material or resource unavailability. It's fair to say that better planning is the backbone of more efficient execution in a construction project. From that standpoint, the future of the construction industry may lie in the integration of BIM and ERP-driven business strategies. Such seamless integration of BIM and ERP may well help drive higher ROI for the projects undertaken by a construction company.

Some airports, mostly international, are more than just airports. They are more like small towns in themselves from cafes, restaurants, shopping malls to hotels  you name it, and they have it. Over the years airports have evolved from being just a landing and take-off place for aircraft to becoming tourism, commercial, and cultural hubs for residents and visitors alike today. Airport terminals and control towers are no longer restricted to functional and operational roles but perform complex roles as landmarks, signposts, and cultural identities. Some of the major tourist destinations like Dubai International Airport, Changi Airport (Singapore), Wellington Airport (New Zealand), and Winnipeg International Airport (Canada) are known for their exemplary and intricate structures. This has ramifications, especially in terms of design. It is here where BIM technology provides a unique solution for building and constructing marvellous structures by optimizing costs and time frames. Airports and BIM Large-scale projects like airports which keep evolving over a period of time are complex to build and even more complex to manage over their lifespan. In BIM you do not merely draw a design, but you build it, and this unique feature is what makes BIM desirable for large-scale projects. This gives the technology its ability to increase the ROI by curtailing costs, material procurement and planning, clash detection, and better collaboration in the build phase of the project. BIM helps optimize the ongoing operations of the facility by providing a reliable base design to define management plans and help gauge the likely carbon footprint of a facility. Its this integration of technology that makes a building stand apart today and BIM, when implemented from the first phase, allows us to do just that. It becomes easier to build, transform or reconstruct (a part of) an existing building with the help of BIM. Lets look at these three airports across the world that are/will be built using BIM technology: 1. Istanbul Airport The new international airport being built in the city of Istanbul, Turkey; is going to be the worlds largest modern airport. The new airport is being built from scratch, and is going to be constructed in four phases with the first phase being completed in 2018. The first phase consisted of one terminal, three runways and a remarkable structure for the air traffic control tower. Once completed and fully operational, the IGA will cater to 200 million passengers annually. Since the aviation sector develops rapidly nowadays, efficiency in developing outstanding standards according to our baseline schedule and compared to other projects worldwide is critical for us. We arent just creating an airport, but also value for people. BIM is an essential tool for us to deliver this super megaproject, Yusuf Akayo?lu, CEO, IGA Airports Construction. Thousands of people are working daily on the construction site. One can only imagine the task of communicating every bit of change in design across these numbers. According to Dr. Ozan Koseoglu, Director of BIM, IGA  the team has saved on humongous amounts of time and money by identifying more than 320,500 clashes in the design. The clash reports are issued and assigned to relevant parties along with updating the rest of the team through BIM. BIM has helped in preventing unseen time extensions, cost overruns, and any other unexpected claims. 2. Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Bengaluru, India We have written in the past of the impact of BIM on public infrastructure projects in India like the Nagpur Metro. We have also had the privilege of providing our BIM expertise to the Mumbai International Airport. The T2 terminal at Bengalurus KIA will be one more in the growing list of infrastructure projects in India to benefit from BIM technology. Tom Shimmin, Chief Project Officer, BIAL has said, BIM will enable us to develop new and innovative infrastructure, thereby setting new benchmarks. We are proud to be early adopters  not just in India, but the world, The project will integrate a full BIM lifecycle for the entire project lifecycle. The combined capacity of both terminals will be over 70 million passengers annually. The government has said that the first phase will be operational by the end of March 2021. BIM could play a vital role in helping achieve that pace of project completion. 3. Denver International Airport, United States of America The expansion plan for Denver International Airport, one of the largest airport facilities in the world, included the construction of a hotel, public plaza, and transit centre next to the south terminal of the airport. The construction agency had the complex task of considering the existing structure and amalgamating it with the vast new proposed one. Another issue faced by the design team was accommodating the weather movement of the existing roof of the south terminal. The roof at the south terminal was an iconic design made of fabric which is supported by a steel cable system with tie-downs that help in maintaining the tension and in anchoring the roof to the ground. Due to weather conditions, the roof moves vertically up to 18 inches. Now, the hotel building that is being constructed required displacing six of these anchors along with incorporating them in its design. The meticulous planning for this was done through virtual models built with the help of BIM. This helped the team in understanding and designing the structure in the most efficient way and faster. These are but some of the many massive airports that are taking wing with BIM. Large public infrastructure projects offer readymade business cases for BIM with the projected savings in time, cost, and effort. Its no surprise that success stories like these have made it vital to incorporate BIM technology in large-scale infrastructure projects such as airports.

In recent years the recession which affected the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, resulted in the slow adoption of BIM. However, a significant rise in the BIM market globally is expected to take place in the coming years due to the introduction of cloud-based BIM technology. The implementation of BIM has helped construction managers toimprove quality control and productivity which is one of the major drivers in the market.This has led to expanding BIM into other management areas. The advantages of this technology have in turn supported the widespread adoption of BIM in the US and UK construction industries. The use of BIM helps to reduce a significant amount of project cost while meeting time and quality expectations in projects due to effective and efficient information sharing; better coordination in planning among other team members and accurate designing of models which extensively supports lean construction techniques. Stanford Universitys Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering reported the following benefits of BIM after conducting research on 32 major projects - Diminishes changes up to 40% by early problem detection. Compared to traditional methods of estimation, BIM produces estimates within 3% of accuracy Reduces cost estimation time by 80% BIM emerged as a supporting technology that was developed and used to address the growing and complex challenges of modern-day AEC industries that could not be taken care of with traditional technologies. BIM or3D modeling has resulted in an abrupt reshaping of the AEC industry in the areas of technology and process.  5D BIM Implementation on Nagpur Metro Rail Project 5 Things to learned from Working on one of India's Biggest Infrastructure Projects  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

It gives engineers, architects, and construction professionals/builders key insights for planning, designing, and building infrastructural facilities efficiently by facilitating seamless team collaboration. The successful implementation of BIM results in increased productivity, reduced wastage, cost control, and an improved ROI on the overall construction investment. But is that just what we say? Well no. BIM application in construction has been transforming the construction industry ever since the mid-80s. Thirty years later, today, the world has taken to BIM technology to streamline and ease the infrastructural designing and execution. Countries around the world have benefited from BIM integration into their Construction Services Management. As per a McGraw Hill report, two-thirds of the users of Architectural BIM Modeling have reported a positive ROI on their investments. 83% of the expert BIM users experienced a positive ROI 93% of the users strongly believed in the potential of gaining more value in the future The report offers some great examples of construction projects across the globe that have benefitted from the use and implementation of BIM services. There are, of course, other such great examples too. Here are 15 stats that prove that BIM delivers value: University of Colorado, Denver Health Sciences Centre An 11-story bio-medical facility spread over 540,000 sq ft area with an expected budget of USD 201 million. BIM delivered: 74% reduction in construction Request for Information (RFI) during the foundation phase 47% reduction in construction RFI during the steel erection phase An overall decrease of 37% in the coordination of RFI The project progressed two months ahead of the scheduled completion timeline and six months ahead of another comparable project The project team estimated a reduction of 50% in both labour and in crashing of the work schedule Sutter Health Medical Centre, Castro Valley This is a notable project that implemented BIM. A USD 320 million project that reported a savings of over USD 1.2 million! Department of Energy, US A USD 100 million project spread over 45,000 sq ft area saved a whopping USD 10 million on the estimated project cost through the clash detection features of BIM. The team found about 500 serious problems that were rectified during the design stage driving the massive cost saving on the project. Aquarium Hilton Garden Inn, Atlanta An expansive project was constructed at an estimated budget of USD 46 million. The facility is spread over an area of 484,000 sq ft. It consisted of 14 stories, 242 hotel rooms, parking space for 700 vehicles, and a 25,00 sq ft retail space at the ground level. By using BIM at the design phase: 55 clashes were identified at early design development stage, helping in reducing the cost by USD 124,500 Over the period of the entire design phase, more than 590 more clashes were detected The overall estimated cost savings on the project were USD 800,000 Nagpur Metro Rail Project, India It is one of the major infrastructure development projects in India today. In this project, an elevated metro corridor, spanning over 38.2 km across the city with 36 stations and 2 depots is being constructed. The construction team has reported that with BIM: 12% of cost savings have been reported so far in terms of logistics and staff days. This is expected to rise to 15% by the end of the project The anticipated reduction in overhead costs by the end of the project is 5% An 8% cost saving is expected over the DPR projected costs An overall cost saving of 10% has been recorded so far which amounts to be INR 800 crore approximately 6. Tata Consultancy (TCS) Mumbai, India The Indian IT giant was duplicating an already built building at one of its campuses spread over an area of 74,000 sq ft. The biggest challenge the team faced was the unavailability of as-built data. The construction drawings that were available only available were substantially different from the actual building and no accurate as-built data was available. The team used BIM to build a model focussing on Clash Detection and Resolution (CDR). Estimated time-frame using conventional method for coordination was three months With BIM, the team completed this in one month which resulted in time-saving of around 66%  Of course, these savings in time, cost, effort, and improvement in construction quality is the norm rather than the exception when using BIM. And Mechanical Electrical Plumbing (MEP) and Building Services Engineering folks agree. An elaborate survey to assess the many characteristics of BIM usage and implementation by Becerik-Gerber and Rice highlighted the following: 41% of the respondents realized an overall increase in project profitability 55% of respondents said that BIM helped in cutting project costs Out of that 55 %, 50% claimed a staggering 50% cut in the project costs 58% of respondents found a 50% reduction in the overall project duration There is no longer any room for doubt. These stats prove the importance of BIM in delivering higher ROI from the investments made in construction. BIM achieves this through controlling costs, better planning, saved time and accurate estimations for raw material and time. Its time for you to consider your own BIM Implementation Plan and BIM Execution strategy.

From encouraging collaboration among different stakeholders through common understanding on an interoperable software to helping construction companies with cost estimation, construction sequencing, and identifying conflicts between the building and utility elements; BIM has been transformative when applied to construction projects. Studies have found that BIM has reduced cost estimation time by 80%, and has reduced the need for changes by 40% through early detection of a problem. Yet, despite knowing the benefits, the adoption of BIM has been slow among construction companies. According to a survey by AutoDesk and IDC, only one in three construction companies in India has planned a digital transformation roadmap for the next 12 years. So, whats stopping companies from adopting BIM? One clear challenge is the sense that adopting BIM will drive tremendous changes to the way construction companies operate. Companies are apprehensive about what this means. Lets talk about those changes and what they could do to overcome the challenges? Changes That Companies Must Make To Adopt BIM Get consensus on BIM adoption One of the primary barriers to BIM adoption is garnering support from the management and other stakeholders. Change is always difficult. Considering that BIM in India is still a new concept and requires investment in time, money, and new skills, stakeholders may be divided in their opinion about BIM adoption. There are also multiple stakeholders involved in construction, so getting everyone on the same page can be a herculean task. Different stakeholders may have numerous concerns such as who will lead the implementation, who will take the onus to re-train employees, re-design the process, etc. One key area of concern for managers and supervisors, for instance, is the higher transparency BIM will bring into project activities and progress. They may worry about being out on the spot or worry about pressure. The only solution to seek consensus is to communicate clearly the pros and cons of implementing BIM, especially framed in the context of the relevance to helping these people achieve their specific tasks. Be prepared to answer all their questions about transitioning to BIM, so they are convinced and green light the implementation process. Communicate at an early stage to avoid any issues at a later stage. Hire the right people with the right skills BIM experts should possess both managerial skills and qualities such as good communication, collaboration, leadership, etc. Additionally, they must be technologically inclined as they will need to also have knowledge of software for modeling, scheduling, planning, estimating, etc. Of course, getting skilled BIM experts can be tough. Sometimes the company might not be aware of what they can do and cannot do, due to which the roles are often not well-defined. Sometimes it is difficult to get skilled people for specific BIM software. Theres also the problem that tech talent doesnt always consider the construction industry as an attractive work option. Considering the dearth of skilled resources, companies might face a tough time in getting the right people. Hence, they should be prepared to change their existing hiring process to find the right people, define their roles and responsibilities clearly, and ensure that they lead the companys transition to BIM successfully. They must be able to contribute towards building a culture of BIM and digitization in the company. Encourage collaboration There are various stakeholders involved in a single construction project. Traditionally, work involves a lot of back and forth communication between different stakeholders. Manual processes are slow and susceptible to errors. They make it harder to provide oversight of critical problems due to a lack of coordination and communication. Thats where BIM changes things. For instance, BIM makes it possible to identify conflicts and errors in design at an early stage. But the next stage is to ensure there is smooth communication between the stakeholders to resolve those conflicts. To encourage collaboration using BIM, companies must sensitize their employees about the intent and value of such collaborations in the context of the larger benefit of the project. Initiate change management Change is never easy. BIM is not just about using the software. Software is only one aspect of it. BIM is more about re-engineering the process to make it more digitally favourable. Construction companies have to assess their existing processes and develop strategies to implement them. They may have to research the gaps in the process, tweak the process to optimize the usage of BIM, and continuously monitor the outcome to see if the implementation is successful. Like every new technology, there will be confusion and fear about the future once BIM is implemented. Hence, the management must be transparent while communicating with the employees about the change, the effect on their existing role, and the overall benefits of using it. The best way to drive up on-site BIM adoption, for instance, is to show a carefully designed evolutionary path that allows everyone to improve their performance. Change the way to measure the effectiveness Considering that a company invests a lot of time, money, and resources into BIM implementation, it must measure its outcome frequently to ensure that it is improving delivery processes as expected. Measuring the outcome will also help the company develop a roadmap for future development and sustainability. As BIM works differently, the usual way of measuring effectiveness will not work. It will become important to redefine performance metrics and tracking and monitoring mechanisms. Typically, construction companies are labour-intensive. However, to stay ahead of the curve, companies know that they have to adopt digitization to become more efficient. BIM could be the first step towards transformation. As BIM experts, we help construction companies to take that first step towards BIM adoption and overcome the barriers listed here.

What Is McKinseys View Of The Coming Transformation Of Construction? The construction industry was witnessing only slow growth for more than a decadeeven before the outbreak of the pandemic. With the COVID-19 situation, the industry is probably seeing something close to the worst of its days. According to a report by theGlobal Construction Review, the GVA (Gross Value Added) for the Indian market is set to fall by 34%. Another report byThe Economic Timesin June revealed that the industry may suffer losses of nearly INR 7.3 lakh crore in construction investment. However, if McKinseys view of disruptions being the catalyst for change is to be believed, the situation could turn in favor of the key players in construction, as well as the new entrants. So, whats McKinseys view, and how does it impact transformation in the industry in the coming year? Lets shed some light on that. Key moves to shape the future of the construction industry The experts at McKinsey, one of the global leaders in consulting and research, feel that technology-led disruptions and the current pandemic situation will transform the construction ecosystem. They say that the following shifts in construction will not only change the old ways but also highlight the new normal the industry will change too. Productization From being purely a service-driven industry, construction will take on a product-based approach, marketing the structures that they raise along with their associated services as standardized products. For eg., one interesting set of thoughts is emerging around housing with integrated co-working-like facilities to empower a greater number of people working from home. It will help increase the satisfaction of the end customers, who will be able to understand things better. The idea that when consumers buy products, they buy concrete results will contribute towards the industry performing well holistically. Control of value-chain and integration with supply-chain The companies will be more self-sufficient by controlling all design, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, and other activities along the value chain to establish self-sufficiency. The focus will be more on such companies that adopt a one-stop solution and they will lead the others.In the context of technology (more on that later) this could mean construction companies will have to find a way to hire, engage, and retain technology talent like BIM experts. Thats a considerable shift. Specialized development The companies will be developing specialized niche based on their expertise along with different segments like single-family houses, commercial buildings, infrastructure, hospitality real estate, healthcare, etc. This will help them build deep expertise, success stories, and intellectual property that will help them get an edge over their competitors. Branding and customer-centric development This point follows from the predictions that construction companies will look to provide product-based solutions, which can be easily marketed to the end customers, and that they will adopt specialized development as their mantra. With narrow targeting, the companies will have to focus on their branding to target niche markets.Their offerings will have to be extremely focused on the needs of that target segment. Customer-centricity will become an inevitable need. Incorporation of technology Technological integration will help the construction industry build better, faster, cheaper, and more sustainably. The availability of new materials, increased digitalization, more data-driven decision-making, and automation of workflows will help them seek a better and more promising future.From building off-site manufacturing units to incorporating robotics in manufacturing and construction technology, the returns on investment will increase manifold.Of course, the base of many of these technology-led innovations will have to be the comprehensive, transparent, and current models provided by BIM. Investing in human resources In India, the construction industry is probably low down on the list of employment options of millennials. A physically taxing work environment and perceptions about traditional and outdated work practices hold them back. This will change with the incorporation of advanced technologies, increased employment of a full-time skilled workforce, and the dying out of many traditional practices. Sustainability Much has been said. Suffice it to say that sustainability is now a key focus area of the industry. With time, it will prove to be the oxygen for construction companies. How can India make the most of these shifts? The value of the global construction industry will jump to $12.7 trillion by 2022, according toa reportby the Hindu Business Line. If India can make the most of the current disruptions and turn them in its favor with the help of both government and private initiatives, it will be able to contribute about $640 billion to this. The industry has to do away with old practices and adapt to technological advancements like BIM, 3D imaging, Cloud and mobile technologies, AR/VR, Robotics, and more, as well as invest in start-ups that aim to change the future of this sector with their innovative ideas and designs. It also needs to employ more skilled manpower, especially among the young people, who are scared to join the industry right now. Appropriate salaries, along with better working environments, opportunities for growth, and even higher incentives will prove attractive. The construction companies can also work hand-in-hand with the government to empower women, who currently stand at only10%of the total workforce in the industry.Such initiatives will help them make the most of the global technologies and disruptions that are set to change the industry. McKinsey says that the ongoing and future disruptions will shape the industry by breaking conventions, changing business models, and finally delivering on the promise of technological advancements. Such trends, if they come about, could permanently alter the way construction companies run today, forcing them to adapt to the new world. And this will help us leave the pandemic and its economic impact behind to look towards a better and safer future.

The credit for such positive transformation, especially in the construction industry, goes to a powerful design toolBuilding Information Modeling (BIM)which changed the present of this industry in ways one didnt even imagine in the past. BIM, an integrated data system based on advanced 3D parametric object-based modeling, allows complete -monitoring and tracking and seamless project planning. Itis an important aspect as the information in BIM requires to be exchanged to derive the benefits. Before we dive deep into the concept of BIM Interoperability, its imperative to understand what interoperability means. In simple terms, interoperability refers to the ability of computer programs and systems to exchange information efficiently and seamlessly. The property allows a product or system to share data and resources between various products or systems via software and hardware without disturbing the existing ecosystem. Where does BIM Interoperability stand in the AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) industry? BIM Interoperability has a central position in the AEC industry.According to an article in the Journal of Management in Engineering, The AEC industry uses BIM for 3D visualization, clash detection, feasibility analysis, constructability review, quantity take-off and cost estimate, 4D/scheduling, environmental/LEED analysis, creating shop drawings, and facility management. BIM allows the integration of 2D sketches with 3D models to integrate several lifecycle phases of a building, making it useful in the AECO industry. It bridges the gap between the users expectations and application functions that werent possible before without re-entering information. BIMsoftware interoperability allows data to betransferable between various systems and gives access to organizations working on the same project to share the same data in real-time. This becomes central in cases where the data should stay in a single system for an extended periodfor example, Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM).  What are the advantages and challenges of BIM interoperability in AEC companies? Advantages: Optimization of Design and Planning Processes: With BIM, Prototyping and analyzing during the planning and design stage helps early detection of potential problems and can eventually save considerable expenditure cost and time of the rework. Efficient Data Handling: BIM interoperability has eliminated data re-entry manually, resulting in dependency on paper. The BIM model has also allowed teams to verify data and designs using the software and later manage documents and design history, outlining future decisions. It has served as the central repository for data mapping, information, and integration. Increased Quality of Communication: Interoperable BIM processes have reduced miscommunication and errors. All the relevant information and necessary process are available to all teams in the cloud for project transparency and, eventually, better outcomes. Faster and Smarter Delivery of Projects: As per UNs research, the world population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050; hence, the AEC industry worldwide needs to resort to much smarter, faster, and more efficient methods to design infrastructure that prove to be a complete gamechanger. BIM is a one-stop smart solution to fulfill this vision.  Challenges: Interoperability is key for successful BIM implementation. Lack of transparency, inability to continue from one tool to another, multiple data formats, etc are some potential challenges that can be faced due to lack of interoperability. Due to lack of interoperability, the benefits of the entire process and across the value change can be reduced. There is potential rework leading to additional costs Data duplication and multiple sources of data are other challenges of lack of interoperability. With the information age gathering pace, there is a growing need for all industries to collaborate and exchange and re-use data in a much more streamlined, systemized, productive, and cost-effective way. With the use of BIM, the AEC industry is on its way to making notable progress. As per the statistics shared by NBS, Of organizations that havent yet adopted BIM, 59% believe they will be left behind if they dont do so. Therefore, despite a few challenges, BIM remains to be a point to be of focus in the future. Inquisitive to know more?

COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption across the value chain. Contractors, architects, project co-ordinators and other onsite professionals are now looking at ways to improve efficiencies, optimize costs, reduce time to build, enhance safety standards and improve sustainability metrics. Technology is the answer to their quest. Take a look at some construction Technology Trends that are transforming the AECO industry: Building Information Modeling (BIM) Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process that helps us build 3D models, which are a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a building/structure. It is the stepping stone to turning around the performance of any project. Real-time visualization of the project through BIM models allows for concurrent updates by the stakeholders and saves a significant amount of time and resources. The cloud-based model makes access to project information location and time agnostic. This information transparency of design and project management fosters better collaboration and conflict resolution between project teams, and faster project completion. If the full potential of 3D to 8D BIM is leveraged, construction projects will move notches above their current efficiency level in terms of time, cost, materials, safety, and sustainability. Digital Reality Capture Countries across the world are grappling with aging infrastructure. A majority of these old structures only have 2D physical documents as the information source for planning renovation. Manually modifying these blueprints is tedious and time-consuming. Thats when technology like Digital Reality Capture comes as a boon. Digital Reality Capture refers to the process of scanning the physical asset to create a 3D digital representation of the building. Laser scanning or photogrammetry is used to measure various surface points and other building elements to produce an accurate 3D model. The data captured through this process provides information about the location of existing - assets. This makes it easier for architects and engineers to plan the renovation, detect clashes early, and make smarter decisions in design and usage of resources. Digital Reality Capture is an accurate survey technology for small and large infrastructures including in accident-prone areas. It reduces labor, saves time, and assures safety of workers. Automation Many construction companies are embracing automation technologies for labor-intensive, time-consuming, and risk-prone tasks. Automation of tasks across the entire construction lifecycle from planning stage to on-site construction to post-construction asset management is now possible. For example, automated or self-driving trucks and forklifts can help transport construction material across the construction site, thus saving time and effort. Another effective tool is the drone which can be used for pre-construction surveys. It can also be used for monitoring the site during the construction phase to identify possible risks. Similarly, there are IoT (Internet of Things) - based sensors that collect real-time data such as location, pressure, temperature, and other aspects for the various equipments from a building during operations phase. Machines can be automated based on this data. For example, fabrication and welding machines can be automated with a particular action based on the signals received from the sensors. Virtual reality and augmented reality are some more powerful examples of automation in the AECO industry. In virtual reality, 3D scanned images are used to create a simulated environment of the building. It facilitates site walkthrough that helps architects and other project stakeholders to plan construction. It can also simulate dangerous situations like fire or natural disasters to assist project members in preventive maintenance. Augmented reality provides real-time information on the construction site. For example, a person installing an electrical cable tray can see the plumbing pipes that are yet to be installed. He will then install the trays to avoid clashes with the cable tray.. Both augmented reality and virtual reality can foresee and overcome design or on-site construction problems. Robotics Labor shortage remains a persistent challenge for construction companies. Construction robotics is a great solution to overcome this challenge and build faster and error free. Labor-intensive tasks such as bricklaying, welding, painting, rebar tying, loading materials, etc. can be easily achieved by construction robotics. This technology helps reduces human effort and minimizes probability of errors, improves productivity, reduces construction time, and guarantees site safety. These collaborative technologies and smart tools help improve accuracy and efficiency, reduce manual labor, save time and money. The most important aspect of these technologies is that they enable connectivity which is time and location independent. These technologies help construction companies adapt to the new normal and other unforeseen challenges that can impact the construction lifecycle.

Safety for the Construction Industry: Are we Building it Up enough? The bricks of any building, bridge, or any piece of infrastructure are laid by construction workers. No matter how advanced the technologies are involved on site or how efficient are the materials and processes deployed, the quality of construction will continue to depend significantly on the people who work on site. Naturally, it is the responsible of construction companies, firm owners, project managers, builders, architects, contractors, suppliers, and other such stakeholders to take care of the health and safety of the people working on site. Healthy, Safety, Environment (HSE) standards have been much discussed, but unfortunately, the construction industry globally has traditionally scored rather low on this parameter. A high number of fatalities, injuries and illnesses are reported from all/most construction sites. It is common knowledge in this industry that the construction is fraught with risks such as harmful chemicals, loud noise, handling heavy loads or hazardous materials, potential of injuries such as cuts, falls or electric shocks. These risks make it essential to audit and upgrade the HSE parameters of any construction site. Research also suggests that the construction industry is saturated with traditional injury-prevention strategies and demands a new approach to safety innovation. Experts suggest that the most effective form of safety program management can be done at the planning and pre-construction phases of a project. Heres where Building Information Modelling (BIM) comes into the picture. Globally, BIM has often been leveraged for better design, improved stakeholder communication, enhanced productivity gains, logistics and supply chain management, cost estimation and analysis but most BIM users havent really explored it enough for health and safety. The HSE performance of a construction site can be managed at the following levels: Planning and Assessment of Risks  To begin with, construction managers should identify potential HSE hazards, their likelihood of occurrence, severity, impact, what deserves immediate attention and what is anticipated for future. At this stage, BIM can be used for worker safety, training and education, designing and planning for safety, falling prevention, planning the right materials, processes and systems, visualization and simulation of high-risk activities. For example, 3D visualization can be used to check crane reach and capability in construction work, or to examine the risks in case of load fall or to evaluate what the crane jib could hit. BIM and the digital environment could also be used intelligently to initiate a cultural change on the site basis the onsite safety data. Companies in UK introduced a Construction, Design and Management (CDM) coordinator at the design stage of construction projects. The introduction of the CDM role has contributed to the safe by design principle and a drastic drop in the fatalities in UK construction sector.  Risk Control and Prevention  Using of personal protective equipment (PPE), training and capacity management of construction workers, using appropriate equipment and setting the right processes, eliminating hazards and enforcing regular breaks are few necessary actions that must follow the assessment phase. Some companies see these steps as additional expenses but the cost of completing any project without any reported incidents is perhaps several times lower than the costs associated with accidents such as workers compensation, medical expenses, material and equipment damage and legal services. Accidents can also lead to indirect costs such as hiring replacement staff and implementing corrective measures. A UK study found that companies save up to 3 for every 1 invested in accident. Besides, the impact of losing human lives can hardly be computed in monetary terms. In 2018 alone, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 2.8 million work injuries and illnesses, and 5,147 fatalities. BIM can be smartly leveraged for integrating high HSE standards, ensuring compliance as per local regulations, cost estimates of the right materials, tools and processes, accident investigation and designing for prevention of accidents. BIM can help with ensuring safety by simulation of vehicles, equipment and movement of people at the construction site. Using BIM models, material movement can be simulated through challenging areas of a building under construction while complete avoidance of accidents. Optimized locations for cranes and material storage can also be planned using BIM models. Review of Health and Safety Management Processes  Adequate implementation of accident prevention strategies by onsite workers, periodic maintenance of site equipment and work area, enforcing compliance of safety-critical features at all times, safe handling of materials, updating policies and procedures, evaluation of risk exposure and monitoring the effectiveness of HSE measures are a few of the actions that construction project managers and site owners must undertake. Here, BIM can actively help with facility management, site surveillance, safety reviews during construction, higher clarity in safety related communication among stakeholders and more. What if scenario analysis, optimized options for vehicle movements, etc can be setup as processes that are part of the HSE management plans and can be done using digital BIM models. Technology will have a critical role to play in improving the HSE standards of the construction industry. For example, wearable technology can be used to track workers individually in project sites, at all times. When they step into a dangerous area, such as the swing radius of a crane in operation, they can be alerted with an immediate audiovisual notification. Technology can also be used to gather site data more effectively with digital formats, and this includes faster access to information about workplace risks. We, at Excelize, highly recommend extracting higher value from BIM models by leveraging it for establishing the highest HSE standards possible. It is only prudent to put in the right policies, standards and procedures in place for ensuring a zero-incident construction project while striving for high quality and productivity.

BIM (building modeling information) is a much talked about topic these days in the AEC industry. You may get different definitions of BIM from various sources. While some people say BIM is a type of software, others say it is the3D virtual model of buildings. According to some experts, it is nothing but collecting and organizing all building data into a structured database. In short, we can say BIM is all the above and sometimes some more. But, in a simple sentence, BIM is the means by which everybody can understand a building through the use of a digital model. BIM is a new way of approaching the design and documentation of construction projects. Building:BIM consider the entire life-cycle of the building such as design, build and operations Information:It includes all information about the building and its life-cycle Modeling:BIM defines and stimulates the building, its operation using integrated tools, and its delivery BIM model, if explained in laymans terms, consists of the virtual equivalents of the actual building parts and pieces that are used to build a building. BIM elements have both the physical and logical characteristics of their real counterparts. In other words, BIM elements are the digital prototype of the physical building elements like columns, windows, walls, doors, and stairs, etc. These elements help us to understand its behavior in a computer environment way before the real construction work starts. BIM can be called as an intelligent model-based process, as it helps you plan, design, construct and manage buildings and infrastructure more accurate and precise.BIM servicesenable the construction industry more innovative and competent by providing the right information at the right time. The construction industry is nowadays undergoing its very own digital revolution with the help of this unique way of working with BIM. But what is very important is that all team members should be working to the same standards as one another, as the complete benefit of BIM gets only from the combined efforts of people process and technology. The users list several advantages of BIM services for various stages of construction work such as scheduling, estimation, risk analysis, more collaborative process, and effective facility management. With the help of BIM services, project parties can understand and review the design more easily, visualize and evaluate alternatives in terms of cost and other project parameters. As it gives the opportunity to find out solutions in advance prior to building the structure on site, the construction firm can ensure a guarantee of accuracy and completeness. It also enhances communication between project parties. Even though the use of BIM in engineering and construction is not new, its growth rate becomes clear, when you look at the increasing number of construction firms who use this new system. It is not only the number of project teams who adopt BIM, but the size of the average model has also increased over the past five years. The advent of mobile technologies like iPhones/iPads etc. expands the accessibility of BIM to a wide area out of the close circle of professionals. Today, clients, operators, and building owners get more and more access to BIM models through their mobile devices.

An US based report stated that the market for digital twins was pegged at around 4 billion USD in revenue in 2019 and is expected to reach 36 billion USD by 2025. Initially introduced to the aerospace industry in the 1960s, this emerging technology has now found takers in the manufacturing sector, smart city development projects, infrastructure and retail sectors. What is Digital Twin? Digital Twin in construction refers to a 3D virtual representation of a physical building with accurate data on each asset collected from IoT (Internet of Things)-enabled devices like sensors attached to the building and equipment. The 3D model stores accurate real-time data of the asset right from the design and planning through post-construction. This data enables monitoring and maintenance of the asset in real time with clarity at all stages of the project. It also lends valuable insights into the buildings impact on climate change and incorporates other valuable information about the performance and lifecycle of the asset. Designers, engineers, architects, and project managers can use this data to design and build a robust and resilient asset. This data can even aid decision-making for similar buildings being constructed in identical environments. Considering around 90% of human lives are spent in buildings, its imperative to construct assets that ensure the occupants comfort, safety and well-being. An unforeseeable event like the pandemic challenged public spaces and infrastructure at many levels to offer more. Workspaces had to deal with challenges such as managing operational capacities, space vacancies, stringent hygiene measures, and health screenings of building entrants. In such circumstances, the adoption of Digital Twin paired with IoT devices could have helped develop a smart building system that adapts to the occupants needs and the environment. A Digital Twin-enabled smart building helps asset managers smoothly manage the new protocols and ensure the safety and comfort of the building occupants. Here are a few ways in which Digital Twin and its IoT devices can help meet the stringent needs of infrastructure and spaces in terms of public health and safety: Enhances the indoor environment The Digital Twin paired with IoT devices can help improve the air quality and regulate the temperature, humidity, and ventilation to create a comfortable and healthy indoor environment for the building occupants. For instance, air quality sensors can detect high levels of carbon dioxide and alert the ventilation system. Similarly, real-time humidity updates from the sensors can notify the Digital Twin to adapt the HVAC (Heat, Ventilation & Air Conditioning) building systems as per the ambience. Monitors building entrants One of the primary protocols of buildings in the new normal is to identify sick entrants by monitoring their body temperature. The body temperature detection integrated with access control can ensure a contactless and secure solution. Similarly, sensor lights and automated doors can help in creating contactless interfaces.  Minimizes infection spread HVAC systems are potential carriers of infected droplets which can rapidly spread infections. With the real-time data from sensors, the Digital Twin can help circulate fresh air at regular intervals and reduce recirculation of impure air. This improves indoor air quality and minimizes the risks of getting infected.  Ensures optimum space utilization With employees returning to work, measures such as space utilization and vacancy monitoring, have been a priority for office facility managers. IoT technologies can help monitor all these aspects and ensure effective facility management. For instance, IoT devices can track vacancy and occupant traffic patterns to plan the space and manage social distancing, if required. IoT sensors can also detect two occupants near each other and alert the Digital Twin model for necessary action.  Conserves energy and saves costs Asset managers can access the real-time data of HVAC systems anytime, anywhere. They can monitor and analyze the building spaces that may require higher energy consumption. This works best in the current hybrid working model wherein staggered employee entries are allowed on fixed working days. On days when the spaces are vacant, the building managers can lower the consumption of the heating, cooling, and electricity systems. Such measures not only save the asset maintenance costs but also optimize the utilization of energy and lower carbon emissions.  In many ways beyond this list, Digital Twin along with the IoT devices can automate building systems to adapt to the external environment and create a healthy and comfortable living space for the occupants. While enriching the human experience, Digital Twin and IoT technologies also save energy, minimize carbon footprint and get us a step closer to sustainable living.

From designing, planning, and project execution, there hardly remains an area that is now untouched by technology. Economic growth, greater access, and the ease of use of technology tools and application are some of the drivers of greater technology adoption in our industry. Engineering and construction companies are embracing construction technology and making them an integral part of their daily work practices to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and shorten timelines. Statistical evidence also shows a growing trend of construction technology adoption. In 2018, $1.05 billion has been invested inconstruction technology.This investment volume has increased by 30% over 2017. In light of this, heres a look at some construction technology trends to watch out for as we await 2019. 1.Building Information Modelling (BIM) comes into its own Statistics reveal that theBuilding Information Modelling is prognosticated to grow from USD 3065.5 Mn in 2017 to USD 8123.5 Mn by 2023-end. Building Information Modelling is assuming its rightful place as a pillar of the construction industry. BIM has evolved from its genesis as an intelligent 3D model-based process that provides a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. It is now a shared knowledge resource for information that gives all the stakeholders such as the engineers, architects, contractors the insights and tools to efficiently plan, design, construct and manage the buildings and the infrastructure. It stands to become the common platform to promote more efficient and effective construction. The benefits of BIM now span from improving building performance, making better design decisions, and implementing connected workflows to improving predictability and productivity. BIM is helping drive better MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) design, enabling real-time collaboration for timely project delivery, and deeply exploring construction monitoring. Digitizing the construction sites is helping to completely connect project information from design, and construction to handover.BIM has more than proven its value in the construction industry. In fact, its value now goes beyond geometry and covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (Eastman, 2009). 2.The continued rise of Construction Management Software TheConstruction Management Software marketis expected to reach $1.8 billion by 2020 according to recent market research. The primary drivers for this are the growing need for large-scale project management for efficient product and on-time execution, increased process automation, maximizing resource output, and better resource management. Construction management software, essentially a construction-specific project management tool, helps construction companies plan, estimate, and manage project schedules, tasks, and costs. It makes communication more transparent, aids better decision-making, and improves resource management and job scheduling. In case of delays in execution, it helps with catch up planning and identifying the cascading effect of delays. Along with this, construction management software helps in better documentation, ensures that no paperwork is lost as all documents are stored in a central location, helps in risk assessment and management, and aids efficient service delivery. It helps construction companies plan, control, and coordinate the project proactively from the beginning to the end. 3.Big Data and Artificial Intelligence makes its presence felt The construction industry is set to feel the Big Data impact as well. Driven by increased connectivity, internet use, the proliferation of connected devices and wearables, GPS systems, job site sensors, and telematics, construction companies are generating and capturing more data than ever before. With advancements in AI and Machine Learning, big data is giving construction companies access to real-time, data-driven predictive modelling to speed up design processes, eliminate waste, and save time. With big data analytics, construction companies are getting that birds eye view of everything they need to simplify tasks, evaluate performance, and identify risks. External data, meteorological reports, for example, can be leveraged to make more accurate assessments on how factors such as weather conditions can impact construction, the project delivery timelines, the risk of errors, and impact the economics. 4.Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality shows what could happen Slowly moving from the realm of movies to the real world, Augmented and Virtual Reality are gradually making their impact felt in the construction industry. VR and AR are attractive options here as they can be employed for virtual walkthroughs even before construction begins. Other use-cases include the ability to provide safety training and to prepare workers for certain tools and machines using simulations. These technologies also have immense potential to improve project planning and to test project viability. 5.Cloud and Mobile technology, as with all other business sectors The construction industry is also warming up to cloud technology. In fact, in many ways, the Cloud is emerging as the foundation of this industrys digital revolution. With the cloud, this industry has mission-critical business applications available on demand. The Cloud is also enabling collaboration and providing a high level of transparency and accountability by connecting all project team members on one central, if virtual, platform. The cloud also assists in powerful data-processing by making more computing power available. Harnessing the power of the cloud, mobile technology is also making an impact here by making the job site more connected. Mobile technologies are being used to gain real-time access to construction documentation and specifications, and to enable real-time data collection and transmission between the job site and project managers. This is helping ensure that things get done right the first time around. The space is vast and there are so many other trends to watch out for. For eg., we will see the continued growth of green construction technology to build in a resource-efficient and environment-friendly manner, especially since presently this industry accounts for20% of global emissions. The construction industry, much like manufacturing, is becoming more technologically enabled. The promise of better outcomes, reduced waste, better resource utilization, lower carbon footprint, and greater profits are clear motivators. It will be interesting to see how these technologies unleash the wave of efficiency in this sector in the years to come  starting in 2019.  5 Things to learned from Working on one of India's Biggest Infrastructure Projects The One Simple Strategy to Save Big In Construction Projects  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

If used right, BIM can be the vehicle to share valuable data during a project. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of confusion around the role of Building Information Modeling and what are the components of a successful BIM strategy. Having a 3D representation of your project is surely a powerful thing but it should not come before data. After all, a 3D model is only as good as the information added to it. This is where the issue of user adoption comes into the picture. Construction is one of the industries that generate the largest amount of data on a global basis. It appears, though, to be one of the worst sectors in collecting, sharing, and analysing these precious beats of information. Simply put, this signifies that the digital culture of the sector is still at a very early stage and that there is a considerable digital gap that has a direct effect on the way people in the industry communicate, collaborate and eventually build. That being said, it becomes understandable that before construction falls for BIM, it is necessary to sort out the parameter of digital adoption on the field. Only then, the industry will be ready to get the most out of the implementation and use of BIM. Push for standardisation first There is no doubt that BIM will take over and disrupt the construction industry within the next couple of years. However, its impact can increase exponentially if the right systems and procedures are in place. Building Information Modeling is here to help people get organised and develop their processes in a digital environment so that they gain time, collaborate more and by extension trust, each other more leading to better data collection and fact-based decisions. For that to happen, there are certain steps that need to be followed: a.Get people to use digital solutions The transition from a hammer to a tablet can take a while but its the bedrock for the digital transformation of the construction industry. The adoption of a data-driven way of working will pave the way for a better-connected construction site with lower rework rates and higher productivity. b.Show them how they should use them Once they get going with the use of digital tools on the field, it is time for the next step which is known as process digitalization. Show them how they do what they used to do using that device. Once they understand the value that the new working approach brings to the table, they will become your most valuable allies to this digital transformation journey. c.Standardise your processes Last and most critical step is, without a doubt, the standardisation of the building process. As soon as you turn your construction site digital, it is time to push for standardisation. In that way, the learning curve both across internal and external projects will be much faster. This change of mindset could act as a catalyst for BIM adoption and fuel a meaningful change in construction. BIM is a data vehicle We already mentioned in the opening of the article that Building Information Modeling can be one of the main vehicles to share data in the course of any construction process. Thanks to wider user adoption, planning can become a part of the BIM model. Through the BIM model, the different field teams can track progress, collaborate effectively on the latest updates and adjust their planning process based on the provided feedback. For this to happen, though, you need people both on the site and the office to actively use digital tools in order to collect and analyse data. Like that, it will be considerably easier for BIM managers to link activities on-site to the model. At this point, the importance of standardising your processes can become apparent considering the fact that many companies are struggling with a vast number of classifications that differ from project to project. People need to have a well-defined Protocol for their on-site follow-up. Establishing a set of standard internal classifications so that all model elements are identified and described with accuracy is one of the biggest challenges for more efficient construction industry with lower rework rates. There is a plethora of different parameters that can be used for the description of an element in a BIM model (eg. location, structure, material) and the absence of a common classifications language can hinder collaboration across tasks and projects. The industry needs to learn more about BIM BIM technology has been around for quite a while now but it is still clear that many in construction appear to be very cautious regarding its benefits for the industry. That is mainly because they havent fully understood the great potential that Building Information Modeling offers. And this is something that the sector needs to address. In most cases, the reluctance to invest in BIM implementation stems from the high initial cost around BIM training and on-boarding. But thats something that applies to almost every type of digital solution in construction. By skipping this crucial step, many project teams end up not having the proper knowledge and skills in order to get the most out of the use of a BIM model and create a unified classifications language. This results in construction projects which are either poorly-driven when it comes to BIM and where the numerous teams are working in a very isolated way resulting in loss of vital information, more delays and budget overruns. Final word Wrapping it all up, it is of paramount importance that the industry starts to see BIM as a vital competitive advantage and invest more in boosting the adoption of the technology on both the boardroom and the construction site. It is a long and demanding process that requires a lot of effort and a unique focus on data. Before we dive into 3D representations of a built structure, its vital to prioritise the data. Otherwise, no matter how nice a 3D model can be, it plays no role if the data that supports it is imprecise.

To me, this is why embracing aBuilding Information Modelling(BIM) platform is so important. I see this as a single, unified mechanism that can bring together people, ideas, design documents, functional characteristics, and operational details of a large infrastructure project, without spilling out or creating duplicate data. The beauty of BIM in this context is that it not only improves productivity and reduces cost, but also improves coordination and collaboration, brings transparency, reduces rework, helps track progress, and ensures projects are completed within time and budget. In a developing economy like India, infrastructure projects are a totally different ball game. Common challenges include land acquisition, lack of coordination, and nuanced dispute resolution mechanism between various government bodies, as well as significant shortfalls in planned investments along with large time and cost overruns. For me, the experience of working on Maha Metro Rail Corporations Nagpur Metro project, one of the largest infrastructure projects in India, was exceptionally enriching. The project  an elevated metro corridor with a total length of 40+ km, 36 stations, and 2 depots  was no mean feat. In addition to being a large, complex, time-bound project, it was one that included a massive team of architects, contractors, engineers, consultants, suppliers, and designers; each with a distinct perspective, each offering a solution to every problem faced. There were a lot of challenges faced, but also a lot of learning was achieved. Here are 5 things I learned from working on one of Indias biggest infrastructure projects: 1. Focus on the end objective: Unlike smaller projects where processes are fairly simple and straightforward, managing a large and complex Metro Rail project was like starting on a clean slate. The challenges faced were unique and there was nothing to compare them against. Since the infrastructure project called for a one-of-a-kind 5D BIM platform, we faced several implementation challenges, sometimes with no answers to explain what was being done or why it was to be done. The challenges with respect to the supply chain were always holding us back. Very often, we ended up wondering why something was enforced, or what benefits we would derive from a particular task or process. I had to train myself to focus on my task while looking for small and large points of alignment with the overall vision. In fact, keeping the overall objective in mind -delivering a functioning public transport alternative to the city, helped me focus on my own tasks better. 2. Teamwork wins: One of the most striking characteristics of the Metro Rail project was the presence of people from varied educational backgrounds, different experiences, and multiple locations from across the world; a team of experienced professionals trying to use one common platform was a pioneering effort. All through the project, the team consisting of design consultants, contractors, specialist sub-contractors, bureaucrats, site supervisors, finance/accounting professionals, project planners, suppliers, and more work towards one common goal  the goal of building a world-class Metro Rail project that meets international building and construction standards and Global Best Practices. Teamwork was manifested in the way each member adhered to the best architecture and engineering quality standards and this drove a favorable outcome. 3. Handling process challenges: The implementation process of the Metro Rail project was a complex one. There was so much dynamism as the process to be followed for any action through the project life cycle had to be identified, defined, tested, implemented, monitored, and then enhanced as and when needed. People had to be trained on the process, as well as on the tools that had to be used for a particular task. We had to overcome a lot of hurdles around process management, organizational hierarchy, reporting structure as well as communication protocols. We learned to adapt our internal execution processes and client reporting methods and adapt them to help us achieve our goals. 4. Integrating technology: Multiple software and the need for collaboration between them brought up several interoperability issues. We had to find ways of integration and we also had to find the right people, and train them on the technology while making them comfortable with using the technology. Since most infrastructure projects use a top-down approach, we used the same for the Metro Rail project as well; and even though this led to some resistance from the project team, we were successful in bringing everyone together. 5. Nothing can be perfect; learn to evolve: Considering the size and complexity of the Metro Rail Project, a key learning was to evolve with time. We realized nothing can be perfect; we had to accept the different ways of working of different individuals (even with the flaws) and incorporate that onto our BIM-mandated plans instead of asking everyone to follow a new way or process. To ensure the highest quality output, we always made sure to implement stringent measurements. Peer reviews, customized quality checklists, and automated software-based model checking were some ways by which we ensured we delivered our best at all times. Persistence is key For such a large and complex infrastructure project as the Nagpur Metro to be successful, persistence is key. I kept telling myself to be persistent but have a little give and take. In addition to process challenges and technology roadblocks, we also had to find ways to deal with the highly diverse team of expert professionals. Since each team member had a different outlook and different tips and tricks that worked well for his/her job, coming together was hard. I think that relying on plans driven by the BIM models helps us. We could identify issues in time and plan to minimize their impact. This not only helped us in mitigating risks but to my mind, was a key reason for our success on this massive Infrastructure construction project.

I have been talking about it for some time and I can confidently say that this is slowly gaining a foothold in India. BIM is catching the eye of various construction firms and contractors, professionals, government bodies, educational institutes and so on. But the country still has a long way to go in the widespread adoption of BIM technology. Perhaps it will help if we take notes from other nations that are using it in various spheres. Here are a few stellar examples ofBIM technologyin use by various nations and what we can learn from them: UAE: Expo 2020 is a stellar architectural contribution to UAEs landscape. It is capturing the imagination of millions around the globe. A little bit of background for those of you who are hearing about it for the first time  it is a $6.8 billion project. Its designed to welcome 270,000 visitors per day and the area enclosed will be 2,000,000 square meters with 2,400,000 square meters designated for various amenities and facilities. Over 80 percent of the site is going to be reused or repurposed. Such a strategically important project is depending on a solid BIM strategy. It is based on the delivery of intelligent 3D models as well as Industry Foundation Classes data. BIM will be prominent throughout the project life cycle. This BIM application in construction will help all the stakeholders to understand, communicate, and manage coordination more effectively than ever. Additionally, it will offer a streamlined approach for all users. The various teams involved in the project log-in as well as navigate either the state-wide model or individual project models without having to go for extensive software installation and training requirements.  It is expected that with BIM there will be 24/7 model access and therefore, reduce dependency on manual as well as offline processes for sharing the information. Moreover, the design coordination, as well asclash detection, may have already helped in saving millions and in reducing scheduling delays. Thats not all. BIM models integrated with specific cloud-based software has helped the project designers to analyze pedestrian behaviors or identify bottlenecks. Its hard to believe that this would have been possible without BIM. UK: It is well-known that the UK is undergoing multiple transformations when it comes to the public transportation system. Among those is a project called High Speed 2, a high-speed railway that connects London to Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester, and possibly all the way to Scotland. This project is planned in two phases, including the 119-mile London to the West Midlands as Phase 1, and a Y-like connector to both Manchester and Leeds as Phase 2. It is obvious that HS2 is a complex technical system. It involves communications, power, earthworks, tracks, structures, noise mitigations, and detailed control systems. As can be expected, the project has multiple stakeholders. A key consideration is the impact the construction will have on the cities as well as the countryside. Completing the project within the set deadlines and allotted budget is a formidable challenge, one that UK hopes to overcome by using BIM and allowing the project to collect, organize, and communicate the data using one of the most detailed visual models around. This has become a key element in the delivery effort. Theres a real sense that the building the model can be used to educate the stakeholders as well. The UKs positive experience with leveraging BIM for saving time, effort, and money in public infrastructure projects is now common knowledge. I fully expect the HS2 to add to that set of BIM success stories. Norway In Oslo, Norway, the Gardermoen Terminal 2 is not only a major construction project with over 100 contractors but also works as a functioning international airport. The location is the main challenge because the builders need to take into consideration the safety, the airport security as well as smooth operations. Airport operations cannot be hampered even as the work goes on to double the floor area of the building. The project leverages BIM to provide a guiding model for the contractors. They also use BIM for accommodating the existing infrastructure into their plans. With accurate information about the existing structures, they aim to achieve a renovation that is easy, painless, and cost-efficient. They have used Open BIM and managed various changes using 3D models for creating an enhanced experience for the users. This suggests that BIM can be implemented and adopted even in the most complex of scenarios. These are noteworthy projects leveraging BIM from three countries. But it doesnt stop only at specific large projects and initiatives. The BIM adoption movement is picking up pace. France had decided as far back as 2014 that it would develop 500,000 houses in a tight deadline, and they chose to useBIM. The French governments initiative also paid due consideration to sustainability in that decision. Driven by the value they expected; the French government also launched an R & D project to develop BIM standards for wider use. Spain, on the other hand, has a BIM Commission sponsored by the Ministry of Public Works for BIM to be applied in buildings in 2018 and in infrastructure in 2019. There are many great examples out there. But where does India stand? To my mind, our nation is embracing a digital transformation in so many business areas. In that light, it is a given that BIM collaborationwill also catch on. I believe that the first step to the widespread adoption of BIM in India will have to be making BIM usage mandatory in Indias public infrastructure projects -and I know we will get there eventually.

We are all becoming more conscious of our processes as well as the repercussions on the economy, people, and the environment. The same can be said of the construction industry too. I have been fascinated with the concept of Building Lean for a while and this blog is about that. 'Building Lean', means to eliminate and minimize waste over the construction process, thereby enhancing efficiency and conserving resources. This refers to waste generated by every process, from the ordering of excess materials to duplicating tasks within a workflow. Why should we turn to Lean principles of building? Let me make a comparison, automation has driven a 3.6% spike in global labour productivity in manufacturing over the last 20 years. In contrast, the construction industry has only seen a 1% improvement in the same time frame. How do we embrace the Lean Building approach? And can Building Information Modeling (BIM) help? Efficiency is everything The skillsets and expertise that go into each project are very diverse. Different kinds of professionals come together on each project. This can be an issue, especially when its without clear communication protocols. This can create conflict, delayed outcomes, errors, and miscommunication. This WILL reduce overall efficiency. The Building Lean model shifts the focus from individual work and ownership to teamwork. Building Lean focuses on the overall efficiency of a project within individual work silos. To achieve this,BIMis a great way to go since your entire project is modeled and planned meticulously. Most issues and conflicts are identified and solved beforehand. Once construction begins, you have an agreed-upon model to follow as a single frame of reference. This eliminates the scope for disagreements or conflict. When everything is planned beforehand, putting it in place is a lot easier, making the entire project more efficient. Using materials smarter When it comes to Building Lean, the clear aim is to eliminate waste, and a very big contributor to waste is poor inventory management. Sometimes in construction, you may not require all of the materials for immediate use. Materials that are not needed in the now are considered excess inventory. This chokes the budget, takes up space and even depreciates in value over time. Poor planning results in over-ordering of specific materials or of ordering materials that may not be needed later. With BIM in place, you can drive much better estimates of what is needed and order only what is needed, when it is needed. This, obviously, reduces waste. Marked improvements in containing safety hazards Better planning results in more transparency, better communication, and more accountability for safety. One of the grim sides of the construction business is the lives lost due to accidents or improperly provided safety measures or training. But when you're Building Lean, all this is tackled at earlier stages. BIM is a wonderful way to drive this value too since it involves the transparent mapping and planning of the project at every stage. One can foresee possible conflicts or hazards at different stages of the project and eliminate or be prepared for it. By staying one step ahead safety can be maintained. The hidden costs of waste An inefficient project will bleed losses in the form of time, resources, materials, and more. Waste inflates cost. In construction, waste is not limited to just the resource itself, but also the chain reaction of waste that takes place as a result. For example, if you place an order for an incorrect material. You have wasted the human resource's expertise and time, as they could have been more productive if they were sourcing the right materials. You are wasting the material itself, which comes at a cost. You will be wasting time in the process of returning the materials which will result in a drain of energy, expertise, and money. You will also expend unnecessary labour, which could have been used elsewhere. Wastage is a blackhole that draws money, time, and effort into its vortex. Building ownership Like any project in any field, ownership is very important. And the lean method of building strives to uplift the entire project by empowering and enabling independent teams to be more efficient. Collaboration on this scale is impossible without ownership, and that's a big part of a successful lean building model. Again, to sound a bit like a broken record but the best way to achieve this is by employing BIM. This will help teams work with synergy to create an accurate representation of the entire project. With this sort of blueprint in place, it makes it easier for teams to identify their roles and responsibilities and carry them out efficiently. Bringing it all together with BIM I guess it must be clear by now that Im interested in Building Lean because of the potential to apply BIM. The sole objective of BIM is to build efficiently. All the software, processes, and expertise that go into formulating and following these models have efficiency at the heart. This means a marked reduction of waste, the safety of the workers, quicker project turnaround, and elimination of errors at early stages. And isnt that what Building Lean is about too? According to a survey byMcGraw Hill Construction, 84% of construction companies stated that they witnessed better quality projects after making the switch to leaner methods of building. 80% of the surveyed companies said that they improved customer experiences and satisfaction. 77% saw a spike in productivity and improved safety on site. I believe its clear that Building Lean is much more than just a passing trend in construction. It is the natural evolution of the industry. This is why I am personally extremely excited to watch these trends unfold, and watch early adopters reap in the rewards!  5 considerations to ensure the success of your renovation & refurbishment project The evidence is in 20+ stats that prove that BIM Technology delivers ROI  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

But not all hope is lost. Construction companies are turning to technology to help them get back on track, control costs, and work more efficiently. In that vein, they are increasingly adopting a promising way of construction called modular construction. Once heralded as the next big thing in the construction industryalong with 3-D printing, companies use modular construction to build certain pre-fabricated units offsite and then fit it with onsite structures. One can think of it as Lego blocks that are stacked one above the other to create a structure. Hopes from the technique are high. In fact, McKinsey predicts modular construction to be a $130 billion market by 2030. Modular construction offers various benefits: It can accelerate the speed of construction by 50% It can lead to 20% cost savings It can reduce the labour costs of a project by 25%. While modular construction has proven to be a boon for the construction industry, it has its challenges to pull off. For instance, if the pre-fabricated unit is not precisely manufactured, it may not fit well with the onsite structure and could lead to cumbersome and disruptive rework. In fact, the company might have to incur 30% of additional costs due to rework. Thats where technology like Building Information Modelling (BIM) can come to the rescue. The Role Of BIM In Modular Construction BIM promotes the creation of comprehensive, accurate, time-sensitive, and validated models of every little detail of the construction site. This level of detail can help construction companies to create a detailed 3D visualization of each component being constructed offsite as well that can fit perfectly within the rest of the structure that is documented just as clearly. BIM can also help in: 1. Digitizing the construction workflow Some construction companies have started thinking of concepts like Digital Engineering. A key component of this would be digitizing workflows. Automating these processes can drive up construction efficiency and reduce risk. Digitization can help companies to estimate costs accurately, reduce the reworks, promote transparency in project status, and maintain quality. Of course, given the wealth of information inherent to BIM, companies can create digitized workflows of the offsite construction of complex designs of components. 2. Enabling MEP coordination Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing MEP coordination can be quite tedious and time-consuming. It accounts for almost 40% to 60% of the project. In the context of offsite modular construction, this is a crucial process because all three disciplines should be aware of the precise location of the proposed installation during the modeling phase. An oversight could lead to a major loss in time and effort. To ensure seamless integration among different plans, companies use BIM. BIM gives the specialists a 3D view of the structure in the pre-construction phase. It enables the specialists to identify potential clashes in the MEP systems and address them at an early stage itself. Modular construction benefits from the precision provided by BIM and minimize risks in pre-fabrication design. 3. Reducing cost escalation As found by a study on the Korean construction industry, although modular construction is known to reduce costs, it could escalate costs if the initial planning is not done correctly or if the workforce is not skilled enough. BIM can help companies to address this issue by reducing escalating costs. It can help companies to streamline their construction workflows, reduce wastes in the pre-fabrication stage, and even find the right collaborators who can reduce insurance costs and tender risk premiums. According to a study by McKinsey, BIM has generated positive ROI for at least 75% of the construction companies. 4. Adhering to project schedule Considering that both offsite and onsite development takes place simultaneously, modular construction can be completed 30% to 50% sooner than traditional constructions. It is particularly useful for construction companies as they can avoid risks or delays occurring due to extreme weather conditions that may prevail onsite. To coordinate efforts across locations and ensure seamless adherence to the project schedule, companies have been using BIM. Right from exchanging information to coordination, BIM enables the project managers to manage the project end-to-end effectively. It brings together all the stakeholders involved in the project, which ramps up the process of communication and eventually, the completion of the project. Countries like the UK and Norway also use BIM to submit their designs to the Governmentelectronically, so they can quickly check if the construction complies with the regulations and approve it. 5. Reducing wastage of pre-fabricated material The iconic 50-storeyed Leadenhall Building in London may be a landmark for tourists. However, architects know it for its sustainable model of construction. The Leadenhall Building is a fine example of how modular construction can help companies to achieve zero waste as most of the components are designed and manufactured offsite. Apart from cutting labour costs and improving productivity, modular constructions are also known to help build sustainable buildings. It can reduce up to 90% of waste. And of course, with BIM project managers can reduce wastage effectively. Considering that the drawings are made in 3D, it allows the stakeholders to visualize the plan, identify errors, and rectify them early. It reduces the chances of rework and brings in precision in the entire process. Conclusion It is clear that the techniques of modular construction along with the power of BIM can help construction companies to boost the progress and quality of their projects. No wonder world over governmentsand construction companies are backing BIM to fast-track projects. Have you considered how BIM can help you drive up your effective implementation of offsite modular construction?  5 Suggestions for Indias Metro Projects To Get Back On Track What Is McKinseys View Of The Coming Transformation Of Construction?

Beginning the initiative with 100 cities first, the Smart Cities Mission is being administered by the Ministry of Urban Development. As per a report, about 68% of the world population will be living in cities by 2050 and the same seems true of India as well. In fact, we are likely to have over 60 cities with a population of more than 1 million and 6 megacities with a population of more than 10 million by 2030. Such a large urban population will inevitably put a lot of pressure on resources like water, energy, infrastructure, transport, healthcare, etc. This makes the Smart Cities Mission even more important. But what exactly are smart cities? And what potential does technology have in urban development and smart cities in India? Understanding smart cities Before understanding the potential of technology in the development of a smart city, we must first understand what a smart city is. It must be highlighted that there isn't a single, universally accepted definition of a smart city. It varies from country to country, depending on the level of development. But irrespective of region-specific connotations, the basic aim of a smart city is to improve the quality of life of its residents. A smart city is one that utilizes technology to improve its operations and services. It is a modernized territory that is capable of dealing with various economic, technical, and other aspects related to growth. Technology, thus, forms the backbone of a smart city.  Core technologies for developing a smart city Most of the integrated solutions that empower a smart city are based on certain key technologies. These are Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), Sensors, Geospatial Technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain. These core technologies form the backbone of all the major aspects of a city like traffic, finance, utilities, waste management, e-governance, and security. And behind all these technologies is a solid core of data analytics. Let's discuss these core technologies - Information and communication technology (ICT) ICT plays an important role in building a bridge between citizens and the government. It allows the city residents to interact with the government, which, in turn, helps the government provide relevant services to its citizens. Internet of things (IoT) IoT forms a network across the smart city that connects all dots for gathering data and driving actions remotely. All intelligent solutions in smart cities are based on IoT. Sensors Sensors are key components of any smart control system. They are hidden but are present in large numbers. Sensors help convert physical parameters into a digital form for interpretation and action by humans or automated systems. Geospatial technology This technology provides crucial location information that underpins the fabric of smart cities. It allows pinpointing exact locations in the city where solutions are required. Artificial intelligence (AI) With smart systems, there comes a huge amount of data generation. The large amount of data generated by these systems needs to be processed and utilized. This is done by AI at pace. It helps derive insights from swathes of generated data and also allows machine-to-machine interactions. Blockchain Even though blockchain is comparatively new for smart cities, it can help give a boost to security and transparency in city services. It can also be employed to generate smart contracts for greater responsiveness and transparency.  Building information modeling for urban development Building information modeling (BIM) is a technology that has major implications in the designing and implementation of smart cities, just as it does in all buildings. BIM helps in urban development by assisting designers in planning and designing reasonable designs with better estimations and greater efficiency. BIM also helps analyze buildings in urban areas to resolve design stage issues. BIM can be used to help analyze how buildings in smart cities would interact with each other. In smart cities, powered by automation, the sheer quantity of BIM-linked data can be used to drive measurement and estimation for future developments. Thus, BIM can prove to be an important technology to enable smart cities and smart urban planning. Use cases The following use cases give a good idea of the potential of technology in urban development and smart cities   The city of Barcelona adopted IoT by implementing a fiber optics network throughout the city. This allowed the city to integrate different areas like water, lighting, and parking, etc. As a result, Barcelona was able to save about 75 million over time. It also led to the generation of 47,000 new jobs.  The Dutch experimented with the idea of implementing IoT-based infrastructure in the city of Amsterdam. By monitoring and adjusting traffic flow, energy usage, and public safety in real-time, they were able to give a high quality-of-living to their citizens.  In the United States, Boston and Baltimore cities have adopted smart trash cans by placing sensors inside them. This helps in optimizing trash collection routes.  In Singapore, house owners in smart cities can monitor their energy consumption like electricity usage.  In Tokyo, Japan, a smart town has been able to achieve a 70% reduction in carbon emission by using smart solar-powered grids. Theres little doubt that the use of technology can help improve the quality of life in a smart city in areas like city navigation, public transport, public safety, energy consumption, entertainment, and tourism, etc. Conclusion India will see a large chunk of its population become a part of urban India in just a few years. That is why it is essential to leverage the full potential of technology in developing smart cities that are environmentally friendly, inclusive, and safe. Looking at the various openings to use technology in urban development, its clear that developing smarter Indian cities to improve the lives of millions of people is an achievable goal.

BIM, the digital representation of a building and having characteristics of real-world building elements, is indeed the present and future of the projects in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry. Its utility does not end at making the designing and construction more straightforward, processes seamless and revolutionizing these industries by offering facilities that go a step beyond what is expected.  Are you caught in the how and where of the reach of BIM technology?  Dont worry; well answer your queries by taking you through some of the things BIM does beyond the basics. Although there are several dimensions that BIM has been categorized into as per the various purposes it intends to fulfill, well explore five ways in which the scope of BIM is seen to be going above and beyond the 3D?  1. Digital Twin: Defined as a virtual model designed to reflect a physical object accurately, is best suited for large-scale processes in manufacturing, aircraft production, jet turbines, building construction, engineering industries, etc. This super technology is accessible by a virtual reality (VR) headset and is stored in the cloud. Digital twins help improve efficiency within complex machinery and big engines and they ease the process in mechanisms of generating and transmitting power. In addition to these, Digital Twins can be used to create virtual models of products that can predict the performance of the object. For example, Digital Twins can stimulate the object's behavior in the case of a smart lock at the door. Hence, it aids the management of projects too.   2. Facility management: Weve now entered the years of smarter buildings and the smartest technology. 7D BIM, when used for facility management, allows maximum utilization of BIM via storing and retrieving project information and documentation. The as-built model information about the maintenance, programming, operation schedule, technical and warranty details, etc., can be stored and extracted to optimize facilities management. It helps facility managers communicate requirements and expectations with the stakeholders and teams working on the projects. It is central to asset management and enhancing current systems in the construction industry.  3. BIM for Health and Safety management: This method will recognize the real state of construction activities from as-built video data based on as-planned BIM data using computer vision algorithms. Currently, computer vision is used extensively in various domains of the construction industry, such as hazardous area identification for safety management, concrete crack detection for quality management. BIM fulfills the practical requirements of on-site construction management. The three areas where BIM can influence Health and Safety (H&S) management are: evaluation of site conditions for workers; identification of potential safety hazards; and analysis, planning and validation of safety measures,?mentions WIT Press.  4. BOQ and BOM for cashflow analysis and project financing: With the 5D model, companies have the service of real-time cost visualizations and adjusting the costs on the go, along with the option of receiving information about the automatic count for components/system/equipment concerning a project. With 5D BIM, detailed information about Bills of Quantities (BOQ) and Bills of Materials (BOM) is offered to the project managers to understand the inventory requirements associated with a project, making it easier for the cost estimators in the AEC industry to keep track of the budget on any project.?  5. Sustainability and Energy Analysis Model: Upping the game in this era to balance natures resources and humans deeds is crucial for any sector. However, this concept becomes challenging for the construction industry to adopt as theres a direct correlation between energy requirements and development. However, with the translation of BIM into the Energy Analysis Model (EAM), engineers could create energy and environmental performance. An (EAM), as described by many, is essentially an abstraction of a buildings overall form and layout into a computational network that can capture all of the key paths and processes of heat transfer throughout the building effectively. Using this model, the effects of greenhouse emissions could be reduced and steer the industry toward sustainable functioning.?  Although the points mentioned above are only a few use cases of BIM, several others benefit other industries. Its only about time that we see the technological revolution that comes from several dimensions of BIM. By now, you would have been able to map the extent of BIM technology beyond that planning and designing stage.?  Stay tuned for our next blog!

While almost every industry faced a slump, it forced companies to adopt long-due digitalization and acquainted many with the concept. We can say the same for the AECO industry (architecture, engineering, construction, and operations) - which is still largely personnel dependent, fragmented and new to the world of digitalization.? We could say that several sectors, such as engineering, healthcare, manufacturing, etc., have seemingly fared better in adopting digitalization than the AECO Industry. Moreover, it is a vastly complex industry, given the interdependencies between stakeholders such as architects, engineers, contractors, suppliers, government bodies, etc. The demand for human coordination among a large pool of entities demands improved integration, faster communication, and coordination between them.? The industry is vast and a significant player in world economics. A recent report by IBISWorld stated that there are more than?3.75 million construction businesses?in the United States alone, and the entire industry is estimated to touch USD 57 trillion by 2030.? But how can AECO players benefit from digitalization? How can they become more efficient and make better decisions? How can the industry achieve the next level of growth? This blog might have some answers to address how it can be a game changer.? 1. Increased Efficiency? By introducing digitalization, in turn, BIM (Building Information Modeling) to their systems, AECO companies can improve every step of the process, including planning, design, procurement, construction, etc. BIM provides the data that can be used throughout the collaborative processes in all stages of the project lifecycle. Additionally, cloud-based data-sharing applications break down data silos to make inter-disciplinary graphical and non-graphical data accessible in one place. These digital tools enable data visualization and effectively analyze how built assets are managed, delivered, operated, and maintained.? A single digital environment allows seamless information sharing, real-time communication, and the ability to make data-driven decisions in operations and maintenance processes. All of this and more is possible with digitalization!? 2. Cost-Savings The AECO industry relies heavily on labor, raw material, and world economics. Post-COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage and increased cost of raw materials was a severe concern for this industry, with fewer chances for profit-making. The efforts to optimize costs and the resources at hand became a priority for the AECO industry, leaving no room for mistakes or rework. The sector found that digitalization helps solve these issues and more.? The BIM models offer pre-construction insights that help reduce errors by identifying potential issues before they occur. Thus, the massive cost of rework and delays is saved. With the correct data, the quantities of labor and raw material required for a project can be optimized.  Digitalization also helps to reduce the human capital needed by turning tasks handled by teams into single-person jobs - with fever errors. All these factors lead to enormous cost savings in large-scale projects. 3. Innovation Digitalization allows AECO companies to experiment and innovate with 3D BIM modeling services and Architectural BIM services. BIM and the concept of digital twins help companies to develop 'virtual prototypes' of different projects. The entire project lifecycle helps the various stakeholders analyze the feasibility of the projects and prepare ahead.? The Architectural BIM services empower visualization, data-driven designs, and transparent analysis of the project. It also allows architects to rethink designs and offer customized solutions. Visualizing the real-life experience with features like natural lights and open spaces significantly impacts all entities involved.? 4. Sustainability? Employee health and safety, labor compliances like working hours & minimum wages, greenhouse emissions, material wastage, etc. are growing concerns for the AECO industry. In digitalization, BIM meaningfully addresses these concerns and helps to upscale the entire system's sustainability. BIM enables sustainable design allowing architects and engineers to access higher-tech tools to integrate and analyze things like heat gain, solar, ventilation, and energy efficiency in their designs. It creates detailed 3D models of a building's innards and overall structure to better match design intent and actual construction. The model also serves as a blueprint to facility managers, as an aid in maintaining and operating the building, and evaluating and enhancing energy efficiency. With better decision-making, more accessible information, better analysis, and simpler certifications, BIM helps the AECO industry achieve its sustainability standards.? Recently, public policy and sustainability-related regulations are encouraging AECO companies to implement sustainable practices, and digitalization is the most effective step toward it. 5. A Step Forward Towards Industry 4.0 (Construction 4.0) The AECO industry is still at a preliminary stage in the digitalization pathway. However, BIM and its huge role in digital transformation could take this massive industry towards construction 4.0. To put things in perspective, the research by Allied Market Research suggests that the global AEC market size was valued at $7,188.00 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $15,842.00 million by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 10.7% from 2021 to 2028.  But the way the construction industry works is typically linearly or sequentially where each player delivers his role and passes on to the next one for his work. This sequential and fragmented approach to the construction value chain could have an alternative model in the new digital ecosystem, but not without some challenges that need overcoming. And BIM coupled with cloud computing could be a solution to these challenges! It will be correct to say that technologies such as digital twins, AR/VR, 3D printing, and many others have become ever more important in the AECO industry. But there are still quite a lot of companies that need to understand BIM or solve even more fundamental challenges in a digitalization context. Nevertheless, the BIM market is looking at solid growth soon. And as the government mandates grow for several countries and the integration possibilities between BIM and other new-age technologies increase, we can see that Construction 4.0 or Industry 4.0 is not too far.? In the current context, digitalization for the AECO players could mean focusing on collaboration, upskilling, acquiring new capabilities, joining ecosystems, solving pain points, and remembering to start small and gradually scale.

Through a series of articles, we will share Indias BIM story with parallels to Excelize BIM journey. PART 1 The journey of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in India has moved from doubt to acknowledgment to utilizing the higher possibilities of BIM. Excelize Software (www.excelize.com), serving the global Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry from its headquarters in Aurangabad, has been a pioneer in this transformational journey for almost two decades. Construction & Architecture have gone through a transition since their shift in design communication from 2D (Computer Aided Design) CAD drawings to 3D models. BIM models came in handy for the architects and builders as it helped in visualizing their projects accurately. BIM models also helped to outdo the constraints of 2D drawings as it integrated all the project-relevant information in just one model during the construction of the project. The ability of BIM is to align and incorporate data precisely to enhance good communication among project stakeholders (clients, architects, engineers, and contractors). It is also a starting point for use of advanced technology applications like artificial intelligence, robotics, etc in the AEC industry. Excelize is optimistic that technology is going to be a key enabler for the AECO industry in the times to come. BIM is not just automation it leads to creative, logical, analytical, and critical thinking and enables a process that accelerates operations. The adoption of BIM has also been influenced by the implementation of policies and construction standards. It is safe to say that BIM is a center of information management for all projects, irrespective of location, standards, scale, after-construction use, nature of construction, and others.  Potential benefits of BIM At the beginning of this millennium, there was significant growth in the number and types of projects being constructed. There was an increase in projects with advanced security systems and sustainable energy requirements. This brought up the necessity of having a tool that would have all interactive data right from design to the construction in one place and would also be available during the lifetime of the project for facilities management & maintenance. Thus, most of the project stakeholders started gaining interest in BIM. By 2015 most of BIM users began to see BIM as a Must Have tool. Using BIM, it was possible to track and monitor potential issues such as cost overruns and cost to completion based on the progress of present construction. During the operations and maintenance stage, locating and accessing assets, and identifying challenges in accessing the assets are some benefits that are also gaining interest. We have seen stakeholders visualizing the design flaws when they could see the model much ahead of construction. Clash detection and coordination using BIM models help save time during the coordination stage by almost 1/3 of the time required using the conventional method. Coordination issues are rectified in the model which in turn helps reduce in wastage of material and time. Construction sequencing helps in checking on time progress during construction of the project and helps in making catch-up plan if there is any delay. Another important benefit is having an asset model which is generated with up-to-date information about the project constructed at the site. This model helps during the entire lifespan of the project for facilities management.  Safety for the Construction Industry: Are we Building it Up enough?

The country saw a historic movement in November 2021 when the government announced a commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars toward building new infrastructure. However, the existing infrastructure is rather overstretched and needs maintenance to be able to support ongoing needs. The report Well Maintained: Economic Benefits from more Reliable and Resilient Infrastructure published by The World Bank in May 2021 effectively documents how good and timely infrastructure maintenance boosts prosperity, enabling growth and well-being of people, firms, and economic systems. Estimating (just) the direct costs imposed on firms in low- and middle-income countries, sales losses due to power outages amount to $82 billion a year; disruptions to the water supply infrastructure cost $6 billion annually, and reduced utilization rates of transportation due to disrupted infrastructure cause a loss of $107 billion a year. These estimates exclude indirect copying costs, loss of competitiveness, and capacity to attract investments. Maintaining existing infrastructure is therefore as critical as investing in the upgrades. Asset maintenance and management of existing assets are not free from its challenges  complying with complex standards set by the civil authorities as well as internal quality norms, data validation, and integration workflows, asset handover and data sharing between various teams, combining disparate sources of data from various teams to create a unified view, and automating infrastructure asset management to save time and money, are a few of the key challenges by infrastructure owners. Here's where BIM can play a significant role. Let us look at an example from a project-based in Columbia, USA. A water and sewerage authority in USA which offers a range of water services, needed a provider of BIM services and ongoing technical support for a pilot study to implement a software solution capable of integrating BIM models and asset data for their Water Pumping Station. A twin asset via a BIM model that includes complete asset history, and accurate real-time information across asset portfolios and locations reliably support better planning of maintenance, repair, and replacement and lesser time spent for asset maintenance. The downtime needed for maintenance can be reduced as the BIM models help us plan for various what if scenarios. The owner of this project had scanned certain facilities and built as-built 3D BIM models. The asset data that was to be linked to the assets in the model was available at various scattered physical locations and was dependent on people accessing them. Since the water supply network is spread over multiple locations, it was necessary to have an integrated picture of the assets in one place. This was the biggest challenge that needed to be addressed. The general requirements of this project included  key user capabilities, IT security, standards, and miscellaneous. The pilot execution stages included  project kick-off workshops, demonstration and training, end-user testing and feedback workshops, system updates, and implementation of solutions. Their Request for Proposal also stated that in addition to the services and ongoing technical support provided for the pilot study solution, the vendor shall provide details of what is needed to scale up the solution for system-wide implementation. For linear assets, the organization uses ArcGIS as a solution that provides a visual interactive interface for managing water and sewer pipes, valves, manholes, hydrants, and other assets within the transmission, distribution, and collection networks. Another software provides connectivity between ArcGIS and asset information through a visual interface. Integration with analytical software supports criticality analyses, which are performed to determine linear assets at the highest risk of failure for inclusion in capital replacement and maintenance projects. In comparison, facility asset information (pumping stations, storage facilities, non-process facilities) is not accessed via a centralized visual interface. Information for facility assets is available in the form of record drawings, SOPs, O&M manuals, service manuals, operating information, and maintenance records. This information is stored in multiple systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning, network drives, Maximo, Wonderware (SCADA), SharePoint, and printed copies. Observing the many advances in technology around facility management, the Department of Pumping and Sewer Operations is evaluating the possibility of incorporating BIM into the existing asset management process. The desired end goal is to centralize access to existing information using an interface that is simple and intuitive. As a first step, a pilot study is being planned for one of its pumping stations to assess the current technology and associated costs and benefits for the systemwide deployment of a visually interactive information interface for vertical asset management. For any asset management project in general, a digital twin (aka a BIM model) would be immensely helpful as it can be a storehouse of data that includes asset history, its operation, its size, dependencies, and disaster recovery. This easily accessible asset data supports better planning of maintenance, repair, and replacement and reduced time in asset maintenance.

This indicates the urgency for adoption of sustainable architecture, principles of environmentally friendly constructure, aka construction of Green Buildings. Architects and urban planners are, therefore, more inclined, towards looking for sustainable design solutions. Theres a rise in consciousness about greener residential buildings and workspaces among urban dwellers too. What, then, is a Green Building? According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Green building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a buildings lifecycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. Green buildings Technology are also referred to as high-performance or sustainable buildings as they fully cover the crucial aspects of building design: functionality, durability, economy, and comfort. While the impact of Green Buildings could be far more expansive, there are a few environmental, social and economic advantages that form the most compelling case in its favour: Optimization of Resource Efficiency Green structures can directly impact the reduction of carbon footprint and conservation of energy and water. Improved choice of building materials, design elements that consider light, temperature, water management and evaluation of environmental impact at all stages of the project lifecycle can make a cognizable difference. A study published in 2010 Re?Assessing Green Building Performance:A Post Occupancy Evaluation of 22 GSA Buildings, was conducted on 22 LEED-certified buildings managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), USA. As per this study, these buildings had recorded 34% lower CO2 emissions, 25% less energy consumption, 11% less water consumption and 80 million tons of waste diverted from landfills. Minimizing Wastage According to the EPA, the U.S. generated over 600 million tons of construction-related waste in 2018. Efficient construction waste management by minimizing material usage and recycling or reusing construction materials is therefore key to reducing impact. LEED-certified projects can avoid more than 80 million tons of waste from landfills. With upcycling, use of recycled material, repurposing old structures, this is expected to rise to 450 million tons by 2030 Reduced Operational and Maintenance costs The construction costs of a green building may be on the higher side compared to traditional buildings. But the asset owners and residents reap the cost benefits post-construction. The sustainable design ensures cost savings on water and energy bills. LEED-certified buildings have nearly 20% lower maintenance costs than typical commercial buildings, and green building retrofits typically decrease operation costs by almost 10% in just one year. The asset value of a green building also increases over time. Improved Quality of life and Durability for dwellers Green building design considers comfort along with the functionality, durability, and economic aspects of building design. It has a positive impact on the health and mental well-being of their residents. According to the EPA, heating, and cooling are responsible for around 43% of energy consumption, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases and escalation of air pollution. Green buildings Technology, which use eco-friendly materials, are known to lower air pollutants and improve air quality, thus alleviating potential for allergies & respiratory ailments. Moreover, they are built to withstand the test of time and involve much lower maintenance than traditional buildings. Offers Opportunities for Design Innovation Green or sustainable construction invite architects, designers and urban planners to constantly innovate and discover measures which can optimise usage of natural resources like energy and water, reduce wastage of construction materials, reduce carbon emissions & toxic fumes, yet save costs and enhance durability and living experience. Its about ensuring sustainable solutions that cover the entire asset lifecycle right from the design phase through construction, post-construction asset operation and maintenance. When it comes to using innovative solutions for green buildings, Building Information Model (BIM) can bring in unexplored benefits. The construction industry across the world is aware of BIMs role in the design and Virtual Design Construction (VDC). However, BIMs 3D shared model is highly effective in the construction of LEED-certified green buildings that require the implementation of sustainable measures right from the design stage. Lets take a look at how green BIM can aid in designing green buildings. Real-time Information Accessibility With BIMs 3D shared model, design information is accessible to architects, designers, engineers, and other project stakeholders. The data transparency enables the stakeholders to discuss the sustainability of the materials used in the construction or to explore environment-conscious alternatives. Besides, design teams can gauge the energy efficiency of the asset and its impact on the environment during and post-construction. Efficient Project Planning The BIM model can also enable workflows to make sure the project meets environmental standards and compliances. Digital construction of the asset helps in understanding the shape of the building and the solar inputs. In the later phases of construction, architects and engineers can enhance energy efficiency, water management, and natural lighting. BIM implementation plan also includes optimum resource management and only required materials are procured thus avoiding on-site wastage. Improved Asset Management On the completion of the project, the BIM data can be transferred to asset owners and facility managers. The building data right from the design stage to project completion is available to asset owners for building operation and maintenance. This makes it easier to examine the performance and efficiency of the asset throughout its lifecycle. Knowing the clear and substantive socio-economic and environmental impact of construction, it is prerogative to co-create a future that is safer, cleaner and economically viable for humanity to thrive on this planet.BIMs innovative model with its data transferability and improved architectural quality can help us achieve our sustainability goals better and faster.

BIM is a 3D modeling process that allows professionals to collaborate and share data in real time, improving project efficiency and reducing errors. BIM mandates require construction projects to use BIM for design, construction, and maintenance and can also include BIM training and standards requirements. In Europe, the United Kingdom was one of the first countries to introduce BIM mandates in 2016, and others, including France, Germany, and the Netherlands, soon followed suit. Asia has seen Singapore introduce BIM mandates, while China has announced plans to make BIM mandatory for all major construction projects by 2025. The United States and Canada have also introduced BIM mandates for federal projects, while countries in Latin America are currently exploring the possibility of implementing similar mandates. However, BIM mandates have not become as commonplace as they should be; a vast majority of countries still lag in implementing BIM and, as a result in BIM adoption. Some countries face significant challenges in implementing BIM, which has slowed the implementation of BIM mandates. This blog post digs deeper into these critical challenges and how they can be overcome. Lack of Standardization While BIM software providers have developed their standards, there is yet to be a universal standard for BIM, making it difficult for stakeholders to collaborate and share information effectively. Ensuring interoperability between different BIM software platforms can be challenging without a standardized approach to BIM, resulting in data loss or incompatibility issues. Standardization is crucial to enable the widespread adoption of BIM, and efforts are underway globally to establish common standards and protocols for BIM. The development of such standards requires the collaboration of industry professionals, software developers, and policymakers to establish guidelines that can be used to implement BIM consistently across different countries and regions. High Costs of Implementation Another major challenge of BIM adoption is the excessive costs associated with its implementation. BIM requires significant software, hardware, and training investments, which can be prohibitively expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and developing countries. In addition, BIM also requires the use of high-end computers and servers to handle large amounts of data, which can further increase implementation costs. The high costs of BIM adoption have limited its uptake in many regions. To overcome this challenge, governments and industry organizations must provide financial and technical support to help firms adopt BIM. Governments can offer tax incentives or subsidies to encourage firms to invest in BIM. Industry organizations can provide training and education programs to help professionals develop the necessary skills to use BIM effectively. Making BIM adoption mandatory without giving the industry the required support for take-off will not help. Shortage of Skilled Professionals BIM requires specialized skills and knowledge, which can be challenging to acquire, especially in developing countries. There is a need for more professionals with the necessary expertise in BIM, including architects, engineers, and contractors. This shortage of skilled professionals can also lead to a lack of standardization in the use of BIM, as there may be different interpretations of how to use the software. Developing comprehensive training programs that can help professionals acquire the necessary skills to use BIM effectively is essential. These training programs should be designed to cater to different levels of expertise, from beginners to advanced users, and should be easily accessible to professionals across other regions. Resistance to Change Resistance to change is a common challenge in many industries, including construction, and it also affects the adoption of BIM. Many stakeholders in the construction industry, such as architects, engineers, and contractors, may refrain from using new technologies and processes, including BIM. This resistance can be due to various reasons, such as fear of the unknown, lack of understanding of the benefits of BIM, or a perceived threat to their traditional roles and ways of working.? Educating construction professionals about the benefits of BIM and how it can improve project efficiency and reduce errors is essential. Governments and industry organizations can play a crucial role in promoting awareness and facilitating the adoption of BIM by organizing workshops, seminars, and other events that can bring professionals together to share their experiences and best practices. Lack of Government Support The adoption of BIM also requires support from government bodies and regulatory authorities. With government support, the widespread adoption of BIM may be faster and more present. Governments can play a crucial role in promoting BIM by setting standards and regulations that require its use, providing funding and incentives for BIM adoption, and creating awareness about the benefits of BIM. However, the lack of government support can limit the adoption of BIM, especially in developing countries where government resources may be limited. To overcome this challenge, governments need to provide financial and regulatory support to facilitate the adoption of BIM. This can include funding research and development projects, providing tax incentives or subsidies, and establishing regulatory frameworks that encourage the use of BIM in public construction projects. By doing so, governments can create a favorable environment for adopting BIM, which can help improve project efficiency, reduce errors, and drive innovation in the construction industry. In conclusion, implementing BIM mandates has become increasingly crucial to enhance the construction industry's efficiency, quality, and collaboration. The challenges of implementing BIM mandates require strategic and collaborative efforts between governments and the private sector. It is also essential to recognize the benefits of BIM mandates in terms of project management, cost control, sustainability, and innovation and to prioritize its implementation in all stages of the construction process. By working together and leveraging the power of BIM; we can drive the transformation of the construction industry and create a more sustainable and resilient built environment for future generations.

A construction firm typically faces challenges like availability of BIM Experts, teams resisting to change and accept the use of BIM, the capability to manage information, and most of all bear that additional cost of BIM implementation on the initial stage. There exist significant limitations in the basic set of design tools. Developers & designers imagine their building projects in 3 dimensions. They visualize their projects as 3-dimensional projects. Their designs are then captured in the language of drawings which are essentially 2 dimensional. These drawings are sent to the construction site and the team of contractors then interprets these2D drawingsto build in 3 dimensions. This transition from 3D to 2D and back again to 3D causes distortion/loss of information at each level. All major construction projects are executed by a team of professionals  architects, structural engineers, service engineers, various consultants & contractors. This team may not necessarily work out of one location. Coordination and collaboration between this team are very important for the success of a large complex project. Today industry is limited in the way teams work together & share information  we do this via drawings. Everyone is working on their own set of drawings. A large amount of effort has to be spent to ensure that the work of different consultants is coordinated. With the increasing complexity coordinating from 2D drawings is very challenging. Change is inevitable in any project lifecycle. Managing this change, ensuring that its propagated throughout the design adds more complexity. While the challenges of introducing a new process to the slow-to-accept-change real estate industry are clear, so are the potential benefits. The owner stands to gain through cost-saving which is one of the greatest advantages of BIM. The major part of the life-cycle cost of a building does not come from the design and construction phase, but from operating the building over 20 to 50 years. Using BIM effectively in all these three phases  design, construction, and operations have been of utmost importance for the clients. BIM Implementation is taking a good pace and construction companies are also realizing the worth of BIM. The concept of BIM helps in better problem solving, more effective communication, and faster project building in a more cost-effective way.

Clearly, the effective and efficient management of a facility is dependent upon the integration of information, process, data, people, and technology. The facilities management discipline aims to provide a good quality of life to the people inhabiting the facility as well as increased productivity of the core businesses that inhabit it. Managing a facility like a hospital, shopping centre, residential, and commercial building is no mean task. The facility managers need to always be on their toes to ensure the continued smooth running and the safety of the inhabitants on the building at any given point in time. This requires collating massive amounts of data and personnel coordination, along with creating situations for the seamless flow of accurate information. In such a challenging role, the topmost challenges faced by facility managers are:  Integrating data  Accessibility to data  Keeping records  Controlling costs  Coordinating with the teams  Managing aging equipment and buildings  Anticipating disruption  Taking timely action BIM and Facilities Management Effective management of the facility starts with gathering the most comprehensive, current, and complete data about the structure as it stands when people occupy it. A missing piece of information can prove fatal for the facility manager during an emergency.A massive amount of data is created during the construction phase, not all of it in synch. Every individual contractor involved during the construction phase uses different tools and models to generate and manage the data relevant to them. The use of various software and technology leads to incompatibility and confusion. This has driven the need for a centralised platform to share, exchange, and control data. BIM technology helps in reducing the inconsistencies in the base data of the building as it is created. And the value can continue as the data builds up as the building operations carry on. BIM incorporates all the changes and modifications made over time in a facilitys design, thereby providing the facility managers access to information that is up-to-date and complete. Apart from the centralization of data and information, BIM plays a crucial role in addressing other challenges faced by facilities management too. Lets look into them: 1. Digitisation of data The BIM information is recorded and stored in a digital format, which makes it easier to keep track of the records. The digitization of data helps in preventing any loss of information, unlike traditional record-keeping. Any input of data is stored forever in the digital files. Its available to find when needed. As a facilities manager, access to every bit of information is vital, and data in digital format is a great help. 2. Accessibility of data The integration of data at a centralised platform in BIM is its biggest asset. Facility managers can access information at a click from anywhere. The information can be accessed fast and easily. This helps in mitigating miscommunication and avoiding any errors due to loss or unavailability of useful information during the operational phase of the building on an ongoing basis. This can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of facilities management. 3. Collating data in existing structures Of course, BIM can also be useful in the task of assembling data for an existing structure. The available data can be captured in the BIM software through integrations with laser scanning and by generating a 3D model of the existing structure. This can provide access to comprehensive building data that can be used to optimize the operational efficiency of an existing structure. 4. Seamless flow of information The BIM software makes information from each team and operational element available at a centralised platform. This can be accessed by facility managers, their team members, maintenance contractors, and equipment vendors, as needed. The centralised data allows the facilities management teams to coordinate and communicate efficiently with each other and align their efforts during an emergency.Their efforts are better aligned since they would all be working on the basis of the same version of the truth as far as the building information goes. 5. Cost-effectiveness and savings The costs of running and managing a facility can run amuck without accurate information and data. Having the most accurate present picture of elements like the plumbing, utilities, security systems, and other elements can help drive efficient responses to problems. BIM can give the most current and comprehensive information that can help facilities management teams respond better to issues like water leaks, short-circuits, fire and other unforeseen events. The work can be better directed and reduce rework and wasted efforts in fixes. It's clear that BIM is useful not only while facilities are being constructed but can help maintain existing structures as well. Accessibility to facilities data is most vital for facilities management, and BIM provides just that.

The same report also revealed that Asia-Pacific is the fastest adopter of and is going to lead in BIM usage, with Europe as the second and North America as the third fastest-growing market.  Numbers like these confirm that BIM adoption is becoming more mainstream in the construction industry. By facilitating the optimum use of resources and collaboration, BIM paves the way for maximum ROI. The catch here is that even with these immense benefits, on-site BIM adoption sometimes lags in some construction companies. Lets explore why. And what can be done to drive up on-site BIM usage? Key BIM usage challenges Theres no denying that for construction firms in some geographies, one of the reasons to implement BIM is that it is mandated. In the UK, for example, BIM is mandatory for all public infrastructure projects. Other construction hotspots like Abu Dhabi have followed suit. Its fair to say that at least some of the uptick in BIM is to comply with such mandates.  In such situations, its not uncommon for the construction firm to be unclear about their exact BIM requirements. Vague requirements, expectations, and guidelines to be followed by the downstream contractors inevitably follow. When the contractors are not clear or convinced about the utility, it becomes difficult for them to explain the same to the team in the field. Another problem arises when the construction firm doesnt have sufficient knowledge and capabilities to implement BIM appropriately. This results in slow, fragmented, and inconsistent adoption that impacts on-site utility as well.  Other potential challenges include the workers not having sufficient know-how of BIM, not knowing where to look for further information or help, how to consume the information BIM provides, what actions to drive based on that, who to go for guidance, and so on. This is, in many ways, the biggest challenge. In essence, its a question of the workers on-site not believing enough in the value of implementing BIM. There is an inertia prevalent driven by confidence in how they have always done things -why change? Potential Solutions for Seamless On-Site BIM Adoption Assuming that the construction firm builds BIM expertise or finds a reliable partner who can provide them that expertise, the key problem to solve seems to be to convince the people on-site that BIM can help them do their jobs better and to equip them to use the BIM models effectively.  Challenges like these are generally linked to skills and competency, which can prove to be barriers to on-site adoption. Skills gaps can be reduced by making some training tweaks at the organizational level. Consider that one of the key benefits of BIM is to enhance the overall knowledge of the construction plan through exceptional visualization. While this can become a powerful tool, adopting it on-site requires the folks on-site to assume an entirely different perspective. The on-site teams need to go beyond traditional practices and realize how they can leverage these models effectively in the projects. They will need hand-holding and guidance in the initial stages but the adoption will rise as the value becomes apparent. From that perspective, the solution to drive seamless on-site BIM adoption could start with the construction company taking charge and providing a clear roadmap to the workers. For instance, they could guide them on how to start using the information provided by the BIM models, where to start, how to gain information on the parts of the project they are working on, and the ways to drive gradual but sustained change. Some of the best practices in this direction could be assigning someone in each key team the responsibility of overseeing the adoption drive from the word go. This could be followed by appointing a dedicated resource who could coordinate between the various on-site teams, the contractors, and the suppliers at the operational level. But even assuming the on-site team knows how to make the most of BIM, how to get them to commit to using the powerful tool? Heres a story that could show just how. An IT firm in India we worked for, had such onsite BIM adoption issues. The site team was not using the BIM construction model. Our on-site BIM-coordinator stepped in and played a crucial role in involving the entire construction team. Each day, he made sure that 2-3 people from the site could take a look at the model, see the area where they were working on and prepare for the next step. They were able to get a clear picture of their work as well as how it fitted into the overall plans. They were able to make their own work plans. This pre-knowledge became a sure-shot way to make them appreciate BIM. As a result, given sufficient time BIM model utilization increased on the site significantly. This inevitably drove better planning and tighter execution. The Wrap BIM Implementation is rising in construction sites across the world. For firms that are just joining the wave, implementing BIM could be a paradigm shift for companies. By addressing BIM on-site adoption issues, it will be easier for these firms to set things in motion for better outcomes. Along with the solutions that include organizational changes, they also need to keep on measuring the benefits gained from the technology and communicate those widely. With such focused efforts, BIM usage can become much more widespread and even the on-site teams will be more comfortable using it.

Changes in the plan can result in a considerable difference in the final cost of the project. An efficient planning system is essential for a successful construction project. One key is, that the project management effort needs to have access to all the required information at the right time. This will help to deliver projects faster, manage resources better, and save money. One straightforward way of achieving this is by implementing effective construction planning techniques like Building Information Modelling (BIM) over the project. So, what is BIM? For the veterans who are here just to hear the stories of how cost savings can be achieved, do feel free to skip ahead if this information is not new to you! Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an intelligent digital representation of all the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. The process involves the generation and management of the 3D model-based representation that allows architects, engineers, and builders the insight to plan, design, manage and build efficiently. They are digital images that help in describing every aspect of the project. Essentially, its building virtually before building actually. At its most comprehensive, BIM involves five dimensions to create a holistic plan. These five dimensions of BIM are: Width Height Depth Time Cost The 4th Dimension, Time ties in with how the construction will look in all aspects at specific points in time. Since this helps to identify the raw materials and other resources that will be needed at each stage, this brings in the 5th Dimension, cost. This comprehensive view helps in making precise cost estimations for the project, better estimates of what resources are needed and when, and also allows for better financial planning. The advantages of BIM technology are aplenty. Some significant benefits of BIM are: Acceleration of project completion Saving on construction cost through early clash detection Better resource planning through construction process simulation Reducing unbudgeted changes Reducing time to generate estimates for changes Better communication and collaboration between teams since everyone is on the same page All these come together to drive faster project completion and reduced costs of operation. Here are some live examples that we have seen at close range that show how projects have benefitted from BIM: Nagpur Metro Rail -cost savings The Nagpur Metro Rail Project is one of the most prominent infrastructure projects in the country today  an elevated metro corridor that spans over 40 km, 36 stations, and two depots. A huge task at this scale is controlling costs. The project used BIM for eliminating design issues, smoother execution, and better estimation of required raw materials. Mr. Brijesh Dixit  MD, Nagpur Metro Rail Project, during a presentation at a conference in Singapore in 2017 highlighted the specific savings the project achieved: Savings in time around 8% has been achieved which is expected to rise up to 11% by the end of the project. The end of the project anticipates a reduction of overhead costs from 5% to 3.5%. Cost savings of around 8% is expected over the DPR projected costs. Cost savings of around 12% have been achieved with respect to logistics travel and man-days. It is expected to grow up to 15% by the end of the completion of the project. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Mumbai, Andheri -time saved The IT giant  TCS was looking to redo a significant portion of their Andheri campus spread over 74,000 sq. ft. The challenge was that the designs they had available to them were from the planning stage, whereas the campus as-built was substantially different. They used BIM to build a model focused on the architectural, structural, and service components. This was designed to be used for Clash Detection and Resolution (CDR) as the new designs and plans took shape. The estimated time frame for the completion of the CDR phase of the project through the conventional method was over three months. By using BIM, this phase was completed in 1 month -a time saving of 66%! Cost control with a better estimation of material Calculating inaccurate quantities of construction material is one of the primary reasons contributing to cost and budget overruns. Poor estimates usually lead to over-ordering or ordering too early. That means tying up funds in material for longer than is required. There is also a steep cost associated with storing the materials. An accurate estimation of the required construction material, how much is needed, and when it is needed, can help in diminishing these costs considerably. Here are a couple of examples of just such savings. For a residential tower project of 28 floors in Mumbai, the difference between the quantity extracted from the BIM plan, and the consumed quantity of steel was only 2.96% per floor. Better estimation allowed close to just-in-time procurement and limited wastage. The estimated concrete quantity for an IT company in an SEZ, as extracted from the BIM model, is compared with the quantity mentioned in the Tender and the claimed consumed quantity by the contractor. The comparison helped the project management agency accurately validate and certify the actual work done for the contractor. This helped ensure accurate billing and prevented cost overruns. Its clear that using BIM can significantly help in controlling project costs through better planning and estimations. Having such accurate estimates of the required construction materials, timeframe, and other required resources could help you save big in your next construction project -and you could have BIM to thank for that.

The shop drawings are typically made for execution of services illustrating details like size of pipe, slope, type of joints, bending angle, length of uninterrupted pipe based on availability in the market, information about hangers and distance, among others. This blueprint shows a clear picture of the entire construction process, specifies measurements, production standards, and fabrication specifications for prefabricated components, details of construction supplies and other necessities. Ranging from steel beams, trusses, and concrete slabs to elevators, appliances, cabinets, ducting, and electrical layout, shop drawings show a wide range of modular components. Lets look at the role of BIM in assisting the process of generating accurate shop drawings. BIM helps identify potential clashes at the design stage and minimizes constructability issues on site. This process of coordinating and integrating all the services and civil components in a 3D environment before generating the shop drawings strengthens the process of drawing generation and minimizes possibilities of co-ordination issues or human errors as compared to hand drawings. Typically, MEP (mechanical, engineering, plumbing) contractors face challenges like  inaccurate component installation due to insufficient details in the drawings, inaccurate cost estimates, poor co-ordination between project stakeholders, inability to standardize fabrication parameters and lack of visualization leading to not-so-informed decisions. Drawings generated from the BIM model are consistent so the challenges of version management are quite avoidable. A large amount of time is otherwise spent in incorporating changes at a micro level, which is saved when the generation of drawing is supported by BIM. Let us look at two of our Excelize projects to understand this better: Case 1: For a mechanical contractor in USA, we were asked to produce shop drawings for HVAC (Heat, Ventilation & Air Conditioning) from the existing design issued for construction drawings. The team produced the CAD output: a series of shop drawings showing HVAC installations. This was achieved by building a LOD 400, 3D BIM model from the design data provided. Clash detection was performed thereafter and critical clashes were addressed through a preliminary report. Once these conflicts were resolved, a sample sheet was generated to align with the sheet standards set by the customer. Had we taken the traditional approach, the coordination effort would have been tedious as everyone would have work in the 2D environment in isolation. While using a BIM model, each contractor could see the design of the other contractors at work and liaise suitably. This saved significant amount of time and effort. Also, with the details captured in the BIM model, the duplication of creating the details in 2D was eliminated.  Case 2: Architects for state-of-the-art international school located in Alipore, Kolkata appointed Excelize to develop an interior 2D Shop drawings package for a built up area of 200,000 sq.ft. The details were developed for classroom, laboratories, libraries, activity areas, dining areas, auditorium, play areas and the entrance lobby. 2D interior shop drawings were generated from the general arrangement drawings (GA drawings), reflected ceiling plans (RCP), elevations and others shared by the customers team. Various packages were developed for interiors in coordination with the structure and MEP services. Flooring plans with pattern and details, casework drawings, ceiling pans and details, lighting layouts, specialized furniture details for activity rooms, classroom furniture and other such details were illustrated in the shop drawings. All CAD & design standards were maintained throughout the project with the help of checklists and a stringent QC process.  Shop drawings drive accurate fabrication and installation through precise and detailed information and advanced visualization to clearly communicate design intent. Extraction of detailed drawings from Revit, for interiors and each MEP component, ramps up project speed and streamlines construction significantly.

Its fair to say that BIM has transformed the execution of construction projects by helping in decreasing the time and cost involved in the building process. The governments across the globe took notice of the benefits of BIM technology and are mandating its use for public projects. Countries like the UK and Germany have passed the mandate while the USA, China, South Korea, Brazil, and Singapore are considering their own BIM adoption standards. To further drive up adoption, the European Union (EU) has issued a directive to its 28 members for adopting BIM on public projects. The governments' stand on BIM is based upon the proven ability of the technology to enable seamless integration and collaboration between the project participants across the different project phases. This collaboration results in reducing the time involved in resolving conflicts. It lowers the operating costs while improving construction quality. The private players are also gung-ho about the adoption and implementation of BIM technology for large-scale projects. Contractors are realising the advantages and demanding the use of BIM, even in countries where there are no government mandates issued. The impact is being seen in huge projects worldwide. The Qatar Rail is one such example. Autodesk is responsible for the design, construction, commissioning, operating, and maintaining of the massive rail project. Application of BIM in a Construction Project BIM provides a holistic approach to the construction process by providing insights and inputs at various stages from design, cost and raw material estimations, schedule planning, the build process, and allocation of resources to post-handing operation and maintenance of the building. Let's look at the 5 facets of a construction project where BIM applies: 1. The conceptualisation of the project A building is only as good as its design, and design is as good as the concept or the idea. The 3D BIM model aids in building intelligent concepts that provide a preview of the building. The 3D model helps in identifying design clashes. The contractors, builders, architects, engineers, electricians  all have access to the complete information at a centralised source in BIM. The seamless integration of data for the involved parties aids in better planning and avoiding delays in the construction timeline due to redesigning. 2. Drawing estimations for raw materials The seamless collaboration brings together all the essential parameters of the project. The detailed model helps in determining the exact quantities of all the materials required for the construction. On an ongoing basis, the parametric modeling helps in identifying the impact of every small little change made in the design of the overall project. For example: Changing one wall will change all the elements involved with it  quantities for cement, steel, sand, paint; everything will change accordingly. Any change in any of the design specifications will reflect the amount of raw materials required. 3. Construction Scheduling Adhering to the schedule plays a significant role in any construction project. The BIM model offers a single-window of truth for all the different teams involved in the construction. This promotes better collaboration and seamless interfaces between them that allow better construction scheduling. That apart, delays due to clash-detections, wrong estimation of raw materials, inefficient logistics are hard to control in the absence of BIM. The powerful visualization of the building design, clash detection, and the extraction of the estimated time required for completing each phase drive better adherence to the stipulated timeline. 4. Project Planning and Financial Strategy The fifth dimension of BIM provides information on the material requirements at specific points in time in the project. This information, in turn, helps in enabling just-in-time (JIT) delivery of raw materials to the site; which in turn helps in cash flows, as well as in saving effort and cost in transportation, storage on site, and prevents wastage of raw materials due to problems on-site making it easier to execute the plan. As mentioned earlier, the detailed analysis helps inaccurate estimations, thereby extracting the approximations for the overall budget of the building project. You will know precisely how much outflow must be projected for at each stage. Better planning of finances can help drive project profitability since financing costs form such a significant part of any projects cost. 5. Project Handing and Operations Management A key dimension of BIM is the as-built picture of the construction project. This is an essential part of the handing over process post the completion of the project. The reality of construction is that, however comprehensive the design, the final site will always look different in small and big specific ways. The as-built design of BIM provides access to the most accurate information of the facility, which forms the basis for efficient operations and maintenance of the facility. Phillip G. Bernstein of Yale University said, Evolution of BIM implementation came in parallel with a willingness to collaborate and share project information, the move toward an integrated practice that is much talked about in the industry. It is this willingness to collaborate across all the stages of the construction cycle that will drive the most efficient construction projects forward. And BIM will lead that charge.  5 reasons why US companies prefer Excelize as their BIM outsourcing partner Why user adoption matters more than 3D when it comes to BIM  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

It stands on the cusp of significant change: a change that will lead to unprecedented financial development with radical improvements. India is among the fastest developing economies of the world. Indias hyper-growth has led to an optimistic population with needs that have extended the resources of the nation to its limit. The largest of these needs to be fixed is infrastructure. Most agree that bridging Indias infrastructure gap can be the catalyst for a massive economic and development leap. The construction industry not only drives substantial economic potential but is also a huge part of that economy. It is also among the most significant employment providers. However, over the years, some difficulties have limited the growth and development prospects of the construction industry in India. Ive already made the point that physical infrastructure directly affects the growth and overall development of an economy. Its clear therefore that the prevailing issues impacting the infrastructure sector must be addressed. Some of the biggest challenges faced by India in the field of construction include: 1)Lack of skilled workforce:The surge in construction projects has added to the woes of ever-increasing demand for employment in the industry. The drawback of the shortage of skilled labour is that it not only affects your output and ability to meet deadlines, but it also puts the folks on the construction site at risk as compromises are made and corners cut. 2)Project Complexity:Modern construction and development projects are getting more demanding, both in terms of design and functionality. Todays smart building demand more modern materials, sustainable building practices, and room for technological extensions in the future. 3)Cost of materials:The supply of construction materials is always constrained, and this pushes up the price. Poor estimates of material requirements, inefficient ordering, pilferage, and material wastage all add up to further drive up the costs. This is a significant problem in a sector where the margins have historically always been slim. 4)Technology Adoption:Technology has the potential to be a significant differentiator in the construction industry today. This is especially true with global investors investing in India. Technologically efficient builders are attracting collaborations in the higher end and organizations that follow traditional methods are falling behind. Elements like Virtual Reality, AI, and, even, BIM are helping drive that change today, both in the commercial and housing sector. But a resistance to change and a fear of the unknown still holds back many from adopting the power of technology. 5)Other issues:For a sector this complex, the interface with a variety of local and federal government agencies adds a certain complexity that is challenging to address. There is a crucial need to improve transparency. The reduction of regulatory uncertainty and approval delays is essential. Creating a system for single-window clearance for approvals of infrastructure projects is a valid request of the construction sector. The sector cannot modernize if the government bodies that commission the work fail to adopt change. However, this scenario is changing slowly but steadily. And much more needs to be done. To foster the emergence of world-class practices in the sector, India needs to invest more in research and development (R&D). Government sector support is crucial in this area. Especially in creating a pool of employable talent to drive tomorrows construction sectors. On the cash flow side, in recent years, some steps have been taken by the Indian government to address some concerns. Credit enhancement helps, to a degree. The formation of infrastructure investment funds like REITs which take contributions from many investors and utilize the funding for a large number of framework ventures are also providing some funding avenues. But finance is always a bit of a chicken and egg story. As the sector does well, money comes in. As things stall, the money tends to dry up too. The only sustainable strategy would be to use money wisely! Of course, to really develop our infrastructure, the government needs to review issues of budget allocation, tax strategy, monetary incentives, and the synergistic participation of the private sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs). But structural fixes aside theres a lot thats in our own hands too. On the part of the construction companies, we need to be open to adopting more technology. We must become more data-driven and nimble. Employing technology solutions likeBIMto encourage better planning, drive better resource estimates and utilization tracking, and effective collaboration should be an obvious first step. In fact, I have appealed to the powers that be that they must make the use ofBIM mandatory for public infrastructure projectsto save money and time. To my mind, a variety of behavioural factors can also help us meet the infrastructure ambitions of India. To name a few: 1) Concentrating on accountability, integrity, and sustainability. 2) Flexible and adaptable operating models 3) An empowered and informed customer 4) Modern thinking by adopting new and different approaches and technologies that may have been developed and worked elsewhere but that would also work in India. India still has a long journey ahead, but the right steps in the right direction are starting to be taken. The vision is that Indias infrastructure will help us bridge the gap between our ambitions and our present-day realities. And if these difficulties are solved urgently, the success story will be unique and worthy.  3 construction technology disruptions that will have to depend on BIM Could BIM and IoT combination change the world of construction?

Unlike a new construction where the required changes can be easily made in the plan, renovating or refurbishing has its limitations. The renovation and refurbishment projects involve unique risks for contractors and builders alike. The challenge often is that the drawings for the original project differ, in some cases substantially, from the actual construction. Changes made on the fly to overcome clashes address challenges between the utilities and other teams, and custom requirements tend not to be reflected in the original drawings. A key task becomes the need to address the issues with the interface to the existing plan to rectify the errors and work within the limitations of the original plan. BIM for Renovation and Refurbishment Projects In the construction industry today, BIM services are used often for a new construction projects. But the potential application of BIM for renovation and refurbishment projects is perhaps under-utilized. BIM services can be of great help during different stages of renovation projects. It can play a significant role in quality control, documentation, and energy & space management of a facility. BIM can be handy even during the demolition of a building. It provides holistic information regarding the structure. This allows the builders to minimise errors and risks through data management, cost calculation, and building a better demolition schedule. The following five practices will help ensure the success of your renovation and refurbishment project: Point Cloud and Laser Scanning The point cloud to BIM services helps in creating an accurate model for the renovation and refurbishment projects. The point cloud modeling is done through 3D laser technology which is more precise than the traditional measurement tools and surveys. Such an accurate measurement of a facility helps in identifying and eliminating deviations and errors in the original plan. Point Cloud to 3D Model The data collected through laser scanning is imported and processed through software to create a 3D model  this process is called point cloud to the 3D model. The parametric data helps in creating an intelligent model that provides accurate information about the elevations, sections, and floor plans of the building. The collected information then helps in creating a renovation plan with minimal or no errors. The accuracy of the parametric data is vital in renovation or refurbishment projects. The point cloud to 3D model provides that, unlike the traditional methods which leave room for errors. Scan to Construction Drawings The scan to construction drawings helps in creating the as-built BIM model for renovation and refurbishment projects. The construction drawings provide an early insight into clash detection. The early identification allows the builders and architects to eliminate issues during the planning phase. It makes the execution simple and free of errors emerging due to a faulty design component. Beneficial to the stakeholders The laser scanning provides a holistic view of the facility. The plumbing and electrical fittings are among the major components to take into consideration while renovating or refurbishing a facility. The 3D laser scan provides accurate information regarding every construction aspect including these. This helps in understanding the current state of the utilities and in defining the changes that will be needed in the old facility. Streamlined Data and Information Using BIM services ensure that all the collected data and information regarding the project is streamlined and easily accessible to all the stakeholders. The availability of information is a crucial factor in getting rid of any discrepancies that occur during the execution of the plan -either at the time of the initial construction or while the renovation is underway. More often than not, errors in construction and renovation plans occur due to unorganised information. With BIM, that is taken addressed. Its clear that BIM can be a handy tool in renovation and refurbishment projects. It allows the owners and production team to carve out and execute a more comprehensive plan successfully. The 3D modeling helps in rectifying any errors during the planning phase. This helps in saving time and overall project cost. And isnt that always worth the effort?   Why smart buildings need BIM?

The UK can be regarded as the undisputed champion of the same with a mandate that all centrally-procured construction projects have to achieve BIM Level 2. Finland has been implementing BIM since 2002. Denmark has mandated all state clients to adopt BIM practices. The U.S too has policies in place mandating BIM adoption for certain categories of public-service projects. So why are countries across the world adopting BIM? Its simple -BIM facilitates better information exchange between all project stakeholders and enables collaboration between teams working on these construction projects. By allowing you to build virtually before you build physically, it eliminates information leaks and keeps design, operation, and maintenance costs in check by preventing wastage. And that should make it indispensable in Smart Cities. BIM and smart cities Smart city projects are complex. There are several teams involved, design, project, construction, and supervisory teams all need to work in tandem to achieve the best outcomes. Smart city design is based on bringing together smart buildings and structures and ecological sustainability. Smart Cities are built to make the most intelligent use of the resources at hand, to ensure quality, and to minimize resource consumption. Given this objective, Smart City construction too must ensure minimal wastage, reduce the environmental impact, and ensure optimal resource utilization. Advanced construction technologies such as BIM can help make Smart City projects successful by giving the involved stakeholders all the information they need at the right time. BIM is not just a technology it is a set of processes supported by technology, that ensure efficient asset allocation. This may be crucial to creating a Smart City. Heres my view of how BIM could lie in the heart of Smart Cities Greater collaboration Smart cities are concerned about three broad areas  smart living, smart safety, and smart sustainability. To build such an infrastructure, there are many design touchpoints. Construction and project teams have to collaborate closely as well. There is the technology aspect to be considered too. The volume of asset information is heavy in any Smart City project and all these teams have to work together to ensure that the information exchange happens seamlessly. Also, the volume of information continues to increase as the project progresses. By implementing BIM, all the project stakeholders can ensure that no information is lost during any exchange. With BIM forming a common platform for a shared understanding of the plan, these stakeholders can work collaboratively. The architects and engineers have access to informed design options, the construction team can reduce waste and ensure timely project completion etc. Easier integration A smart city project depends on integration to develop an intelligent integrated infrastructure for transport, communication, energy consumption, etc. -at the building, as well as on the city scale. In such projects, the buildings remain permanently integrated with these other bases. Putting this jigsaw together is a complex task to manage. By employing BIM, invested teams enable a free flow of standardized information between systems and open up collaboration channels that facilitate these integrations easily. Again, there is no information loss, every party is aware of their KPIs and anomalies can be identified easily. Easier project visualization Obviously, converting a design masterpiece into physical structures requires great precision. BIMs highly detailed, precise, and constructible 3D structural models help in project visualization from conception to completion. BIM models can also easily test building constructability in advance and ensure that errors, rework and any wastage is minimized. BIM can also be used to determine the exact amount of material needed and thereby reduces wastage to negligible amounts. By reducing waste associated with construction, not only can the cost of construction and time be reduced but the environmental impact of the construction process can also be curtailed. 3D modeling Of course, 3D modeling isnt just for design. 3D modeling also allows us to level the model infrastructure that needs to be built underground. The construction team thus know how far to dig to not break an existing pipeline or a fiber-optic cable. Drainage, bridge, and highway designers can also leverage the same immersive model to optimize the Smart City infrastructure as everything here is geo-referenced. BIM also facilitates the study and visualization of darkness, lighting, skyline studies, line of sight, etc. to enable more data-driven decisions regarding Smart City construction. This will help improve the operational efficiencies of the Smart City when its up and running. Data convergence Connectivity and data lie at the heart of any successful Smart City project. Consider a future not too far away, where BIM meets data points such as location data from mobile phones or satellites. Think how this could impact ongoing maintenance, issue reporting and fixing, and repair operations by making them more proactive. BIM could essentially provide a Smart City nervous system. The Smart City could leverage this to communicate information, improve environmental performance and the utility and transport network, and increase sustainability both during construction and building maintenance. I saw a quote from Lean Doody, Smart City Lead, Arup, on the role of BIM in the Smart City context. In this statement he says, BIM is transforming, not only the way buildings are designed and constructed, but also how they are managed and developed in the light of changing customer needs. In so doing, BIM is changing relationships and business models across the whole value chain. Meanwhile, at a city level, the technology-enabled city is an untapped source of sustainable growth and represents a powerful approach for tackling unprecedented environmental and economic challenges. By unlocking technology, infrastructure, and public data, cities can open up new value chains, spawning innovative applications and information products that make sustainable modes of city living and working possible. The data delivered through BIM at a building level will be an important enabler of these new value chains. I could not agree more.

How To Make A Dent In The Rs. 4.11 Trillion Cost Overruns In India's Infrastructure Projects? Indias demand for infrastructure projects is huge. These projects involve the construction of roads, bridges, dams, and other structures that will form the backbone of the economy. In fact, estimates are that even a couple of years ago, 9% of Indias GDP was spent on construction infrastructure. But, the construction sector in India also suffers from multiple issues that hold up the construction of such projects. An array of challenges including land acquisition, labour availability and management, and traditional delivery practices cause delays and push up construction costs. In fact, a recent report by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation says that from 412 major infrastructure projects in the country have suffered cost overruns to the tune of Rs 4.11 Lakh Crores. Cost overruns are a serious issue especially in a resource-constrained nation like India. So how can infrastructure management and construction companies reduce or eliminate cost overruns? The answer lies in technology and digital transformation, 2 principles, which have often been ignored by the sector in India even though developed nations have been making steady progress. So, lets explore how technology can help eliminate cost overruns in a construction project across various stages: Improving Design Efficiency Architectural design along with other preconstruction consulting services forms a sizeable portion of the project cost and can range as much as 15% of the entire project budget. Using Building Information Modelling, architects and design engineers can visualize the project in every possible granular format. Using 3D modelling, it becomes easier to map out building components and accommodate requirements to ensure that the design is as comprehensive and foolproof as possible. Incomplete or inaccurate plans from engineers can lead to serious problems during the construction and can lead to costly disputes and substandard construction work being done by contractors owing to lack of clarity. With a digital backbone managing the entire design process, it is easier to consolidate inputs from various stakeholders, establish common ground, make better material and resource estimates, and drive on-site efforts faster and more efficiently. I have appealed previously to the government to make BIM mandatory for public infrastructure projects like the UK. It was reported some time ago that the UK government expected to save over 400 million pounds each year due to the application of BIM. Manage Scope Changes One of the most important challenges in a construction project is the management of changes. No matter, how much effort was taken to take into confidence, all stakeholders during the design phase, scope changes are bound to creep in during construction. It is considered normal here. Since it is impossible to eliminate scope changes during construction, the next best thing to do is to use technology to manage and integrate these changes into the project plan as seamlessly as possible without escalating costs. A centralized BIM platform can help in capturing changes and communicating the same along with the changed course of action to all project team members both on the job site on their mobile phones, as well as key personnel in areas such as procurement, vendor management, finance, and supply chain. Providing the right information about changes transparently at the right time can help in preventing clashes, reducing the timeline for contractors to incorporate changes, prevent resource wastage, and get necessary legal or regulatory compliance approvals for accommodating the change. Manage Disputes In several high-value projects, the number of stakeholders involved is quite large in number. One major outcome of this high number is that the number of disputes arising during construction will be high as well. More disputes will lead to more delays and ultimately more cost overruns. Design issues alone account for nearly 38% of all disputes in a construction project according to a study by Engineers Daily. Most disputes happen due to inefficient project planning and management which is done predominantly by manual means. By bringing on board a seamless BIM and project management platform, it becomes easier for different stakeholders to be held accountable for their activities. Through transparent reporting of progress, every calculated move in the construction stage can be vetted by all stakeholders and this will eliminate disputes over the finished product. Eventually, virtual demonstrations coupled with modern-day techniques like Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality can help stakeholders visualize design elements in more realistic perspectives and give their suggestions upfront and thus eliminate future disputes. Project management platforms help define daily activities, schedules, and task priorities to ensure that the construction progresses smoothly and in alignment with approved design principles. Eliminate Errors for Administration Every construction project involves a hefty administrative back-end operation taking care of various compliance, auditing, and approval processes. When these activities are done manually, the scope for errors is high and at times errors in administrative calculations can prove to be costly. It could lead to various site supervisors or contractors not being informed about changes, guidelines, or safety protocols which in turn can create regulatory and legal compliance complications for the project leading to delays and cost overruns. With the help of technology, several mundane manual processes can be automated. For instance, reporting can be automated and made transparent. This will ensure that all administrative processes follow due diligence and any human errors are eliminated before their impact makes its presence felt in the actual construction site. Cost overruns are a serious problem in the Indian infrastructure sector. By controlling them, there is a huge opportunity for optimizing the value delivered from the investments being made by the government on behalf of the people. By leveraging digital technology like BIM, projects can be better managed with lower scope for cost overruns. Be it automation of administrative efforts or improving design efficiency, there is a huge potential for Indian infrastructure players to capitalize on the several benefits of technology in their daily operations.

Five Things About BIM You Must Know! A large number of players from the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) industry have been venturing intoBIM Adoption in the last few years. Some are at the primary stage, trying to draw the business strategies around BIM, some have implemented BIM for several projects, and others are proud enthusiasts of BIM looking for opportunities to implement BIM services rightly. Despite the category, everyone in the AECO industry should know the BIM mandates, standards, and more such features that equip us with more profound knowledge about BIM. We'll bring you five things you should know about BIM, so scroll through this article to dive in! 1. BIM Mandate: With BIM gaining much momentum worldwide, governments are pushing industry practitioners to adopt BIM on a large scale in the AECO sector. Hence mandates requiring BIM compliance from companies involved in public projects become vital to this drive. As explained by many, 'BIM mandate is a set of implemented government policies ensuring that BIM is a necessity for large-scale complex projects.' In a broader view, under the mandate, project owners, contractors, and designers are required to adopt BIM at various stages like preconstruction, construction and for uses from 3D to 8D. At the same time, manufacturers are required to share information about rich BIM objects that are incorporated into the project. Implementing any mandate involves a lot of strategy and planning for a smooth transition and, eventually, its execution. The mandates vary for different countries and are put in place to help the AECO sector become BIM compliant. The first country to implement the BIM mandate was Denmark (2007). Other countries, such as Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, Germany, the UK, the USA, etc., have joined in with full swing. 2. BIM Standards: BIM standards are guidelines and procedures recognized by different authorities at an international level to optimize operational management during the life cycle of the structure. It's essential to have a set handbook with regulations to bring order to the system. This way, processes can be better organized, the overall quality of projects can be improved, and collaborations between work teams in different parts of the world could occur seamlessly. BIM standards are also necessary to be in place to avoid potential integration challenges in countries where BIM is not regulated at a national level, and they follow their standards. The first international BIM standard that regulates BIM is ISO 19650. This international standard regulates the management of information on the entire life cycle of a built assetfrom the design stage to the maintenance stageusing BIM. In addition, other regulatory standards are ISO 16739 (an open international standardfor BIM data shared between software applications used by different participants in a construction or facility management project) andISO 12006 (this defines the classification of the components of a building product).  3. History of BIM: It is rightly said that BIM has long existed as a concept; however, it had to wait for decades of technology to match its applicability. In 1957, an architectural expert described viewing a model from different angles and built a Building Description System. The year 1980 saw the introduction of ArchiCAD, which later became the first BIM-enabled software available on a personal computer. Post-1993, several programs were developed that gradually revolutionized the concept of BIM. Revit, a notable technology solution in 2000, changed the game as it became the software for designing everythinggovernment contracts on bridges, large office buildings, and tiny houses. Gradually, starting from 2010, there have been numerous advancements in the technology and process of BIM that its present stage is well-described in a research paper titled 'BIMHistory and Trends' as 'BIM has formed the nucleus of significant development potential for the future architectural workflows.  4. openBIM:A researcher explains that openBIM provides a common language for the exchange of information within a multidisciplinary project team.' It allows sharing of data using open standards, streamlining work and minimizing errors. openBIM improves the usability, management, accessibility, and sustainability of digital data in the built asset industry. It not only facilitates interoperability but also gives flexibility to the stakeholders to transform the traditional ways of working within teams by incorporating new technologies. It is said that 'Firms that adopt an openBIM approach develop cross-party collaboration, enhanced communication, and industry-standard exchange methodologies. This delivers better project outcomes, greater predictability, improved performance, and increased safety with reduced risk.  5. closedBIM: In contrast to openBIM, closed BIM is explained as a BIM environment requiring project stakeholders to use the same software platform throughout the building process. Unlike with openBIM, with closed BIM, data can be accessed only in the native file as it doesn't allow conversion of files. The consensus can be said to choose openBIM over closed BIM as the latter Limits the collaboration method only to those with the same software/version, doesn't allow aggregation of data produced by different software used for the completion of different aspects of work, and restricts the accessibility and readability of the data without the license to use that software.  These are just five of the many essentials of BIM that help the AECO Industry patrons with stronger feet and make informed choices.

Now it was necessary to move beyond this and look at what more can be done using the BIM models. Dimensions of BIM from 3D to 8D were a topic of discussion and a significant number of organizations decided to implement these. Having an integrated 5D BIM platform was being mandated on some large infra projects. Using the BIM models to create asset models for facility management was also gaining acceptance.  All this meant that digital transformation was happening at various levels. The pandemic hit us in 2020 and the entire ecosystem was impacted. But this also opened for us new avenues of working. Working remotely, using technology to speed up construction, ensuring that there are minimal time and cost overruns on projects gained importance, along with acceptance of digitalization.  In the examples we are sharing, we wish to highlight that BIM adoption has matured and it should be looked at the norm.  Phase 1: Maha Metro - 2016 - Ongoing Maha Metro is the first organization in the country to implement 5D BIM project visualization. 5D BIM is a digital project management concept that integrates many softwares seamlessly. This implementation has enabled Maha Metro to control quality, cost and time very effectively.  In a country where large infrastructure projects have gained notoriety for time and cost overruns and have often delivered dubious quality, using the new 5D project management platform, Nagpur Metro has broken from the traditional vicious circle of project management and delivered consistent quality along with timebound completion.  The traditional approach followed in the construction industry often struggles to deliver the project on time and within budget. Lack of precision and exactness in the process of information flow leads to conflicts between stakeholders. Design management, document control, quality assurance, timely completion, cost control, risk mitigation, maintaining safe construction environment and effective operation and maintenance of services are among the most common challenges faced by the construction industry. Reduced rework, reduced coordination problems, better communication between various stakeholders, reduced documentation errors, fewer claims, reduced paperwork, reduction in time and cost overrun, reduction in lifecycle costs are amongst the main benefits of 5D BIM.  The results show that 5D BIM based digital project management system integrates all the processes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project, right from design through operation and maintenance.  Nagpur metro was the first 5D BIM implementation in India. This project has certainly paved the way for many such applications now. In the last 2 years (2020-2021) almost all public infrastructure projects are mandating BIM and its various dimensions to be digitally integrated with planning, construction management, cost monitoring, asset management and even digital twins.   Phase 2: Mixed Use development - 2022 The current state of BIM adoption and implementation is drastically different from when we started 18 yrs ago. BIM implementation is mandated as part of the scope from day 1. Contracts include this, consultants have the required knowledge and owners are ready to look at the long-term benefits this first step will provide. On a very recently started project we have seen the acceptance of implementing BIM and going beyond. Some highlights are: This is a mixed-use retail centre situated in Mumbai. BIM has been mandated by the developers RFP was generated, bids were invited, and a bidding portal was used The RFP mentioned that a design model will be provided by the developers. This was an example which demonstrated that there were no barriers to adoption, design had started with 3D, BIM standards were available, and goals has been clearly laid out. Architect and MEPF consultants on this project are building their own models. The BIM team at Excelize is only building structural models The architects have setup CDE and are driving the entire workflow. Bids had to submitted with prior experience documents, reference check contacts, approach and methodology for this project, team profile, confirmation on capability of using CDE Technical evaluation was done through presentations and discussion with the clients team. The scope extended itself beyond BIM modeling, as laid out in the contract. It included: Architectural base BIM model BIM model for structure. Extracting Bill of Quantities (BOQ) from clash free design model 2D GFC extraction for structural services. Construction simulation (4D), cost management (5D), asset model, Digital twin The client decided to implement Digital twin in phase 2 as the technology and process would have expectedly evolved as they reach this phase in 3-4 years.  BIM standards and implementation framework Though BIM is a technology that can be pivotal to enhancing productivity and optimizing costs for construction, it is not guided by a set of standards or rules for its implementation. As there is no single body mandating BIM, the standards and implementation framework has been decided largely by users. BIM Execution Plan (BEP) is the first attempt at creating a framework and standing of processes involved. Back in 2010, Excelize worked on an airport project, wherein no BEP was generated, no standards for the project were documented. In 2014, the Excelize team worked for an IT giant that was setting up 10 campuses in India. While BEP wasnt generated for this project as well, the standards were setup and made mandatory too. In 2015, the BEP for Maharashtra Metro was well detailed and thought out. It was generated in consultation with all the stakeholders and owners. As part of the BEP, employers information requirements, master information delivery plan, task information delivery plan, Level of Details (LOD) matrix, and Level of Information (LOI) guidelines, were documented and implemented. BS PAS 1199 standards were followed for this project. In 2020-2021, we have many tools that allow us to generate the BEP. Based on the project or organization goals, BEP can be generated to various global standards. There is a movement that insists on the adoption of a uniform, global standard i.e., ISO 19650.

Some construction projects had to be delayed, while some got canceled due to the shortage of supplies such as structural steel and glass that usually comes from Asia. Also, unlike other industries where the workforce can work remotely, construction projects required workers to work on-site. Typically, construction companies do not rely heavily on digital tools as they are risk-averse and fragmented in nature. However, the pandemic has compelled them to leverage technology more. For example, McKinsey observed that designers and engineers are increasingly using Building Information Management (BIM) to manage projects and speed up project delivery. With vaccines being delivered and the industry preparing for post-pandemic recovery, we foresee technology playing a central role. Role Of Technology In Post-Pandemic Construction In The USA 1. Cloud-based collaboration tools Due to social distancing, companies had to resort to using collaboration tools to exchange data and communicate in real-time. An integrated cloud platform enables all stakeholders to share data and information on one platform. It allows them to streamline processes and improve their productivity. The best part is the stakeholders can continue working from remote areas. They do not have to be present at the site. This saves their time and effort in completing the project. Considering that all the information is shared on a unified cloud-based platform, stakeholders can save time in to-and-fro communication and manage enterprise-wide project communications efficiently. 2. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Contractors can address specific design and inspection tasks remotely by using AR and VR. To begin with, AR can be used to walk the contractors through the site to review it even if they are not present at the site. Onsite too, AR also helps contractors view the finer details of the project. All they have to do is hold a smartphone or tablet with the camera facing the site. They can see the scaled-up version of the site and see things that cannot be viewed through the naked eye. VR, on the other hand, helps contractors to remotely train workers even as they work on the site. Most importantly, AR and VR help companies to save money on costly mistakes by detecting errors ahead of time. 3. BIM The World Economic Forum praised BIM for its contribution to transforming the construction industry during COVID-19. Although BIM has been used by the industry for decades, its benefit became even more apparent during the lockdown. It enabled the stakeholders to continue progress even though they were working from remote areas. They were able to plan projects better, mitigate risks, and streamline operations and maintenance. All the information from the field was updated in real-time into BIM models, making it easier for the stakeholders to monitor the projects progress. We anticipate an uptick in the usage of BIM models for smarter planning and designing of the buildings. 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation Like every industry, the construction industry also reported productivity concerns due to social distancing norms and lockdowns. Post-pandemic, the construction industry will be under immense pressure to improve its productivity. Thats where AI and automation will help. Companies can leverage AI to automate many of their processes such as scheduling tasks. So, the work can continue even without human intervention. The tasks will be completed on time without any error. AI can also be used to streamline process workflows, do safety inspections, and ensure the overall quality of the project. In a nutshell, AI can help improve the overall process management in the project. According to Accenture, AI can increase industry profits by 71% by 2035. 5. Data analytics Data analytics empowers companies to gain a competitive advantage. It enables them to analyze historical data and current data and use it to predict important future outcomes. Using data analytics will help companies to anticipate issues and prepare for them to mitigate risks. Given the enormous losses faced by the industry during the pandemic, data analytics will be a perfect option to help companies streamline their processes and fix problems proactively to avoid further losses. It enables the stakeholders to take proactive decisions instead of reactive ones like they are accustomed to doing normally. Apart from that, data analytics helps stakeholders to determine better budgets and schedules aligned with the scope of the project. Technology will reshape the way the construction industry functions. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, 70% of contractors believe that using technology will help them improve productivity and the safety of workers. It will enable them to reduce costs, manage projects efficiently, streamline the construction process, and accelerate the speed of delivering the project.

The complex design was fully coordinated using 3D BIM models. Excelize team was entrusted with the challenge of showcasing the benefits of BIM adoption for coordination. A Proof-Of-Concept (POC) was conducted for a small area before the work on the entire terminal was done. No BEP was generated, no standards were defined and documented, and only BIM goal was to generate coordinated 2D drawings from clash-free models. Observations: The input data was incomplete with inadequate information. Using these at site would have resulted in a lot of on-site decision resulting in potential delays. A lot of clashes were detected and resolved using the model. This ensured that Minimal decisions were taken on site No undocumented changes at site Very little rework at site thus time and cost overruns were minor Every designer had his/her perspective for resolving the clashes. Excelize team took initiative to document the rules for clash resolution that could be shared with the design teams, and this led to the first piece of standardization Value engineering exercise was conducted in coordination with design team at site, which involved re-design and second round of clash resolution. Clash free areas and models were produced which the site team was not capable of viewing. Lack of trained staff, infrastructure (hardware/software) and resistance to accept change were some of the barriers to implementation. At the end of this phase, walkthroughs were generated from the model which the team used for inspection during installation. Phase 2: Star rated Hotel - 2012 The goal for this star rated hotel project was to demonstrate the benefits of BIM models through the design and installation phase. The ability to visualize the entire space in 3D, to plan the services routing more efficiently, identify clashes early in the design process and how all of this supports the onsite team during the installation process were some indicators. Observations: The client team was comfortable with their traditional approach of design co-ordination and had been rather reluctant to change. It was incredibly difficult to convince them in favour of BIM adoption There was no team identified to review and utilize the information that would be shared by the BIM team and no training was imparted to the existing team for deploying BIM Information in drawings was incomplete, so, models had to be made based on certain assumptions. Excelize worked remotely on building the model had a part time BIM coordinator driving the in-person meetings, getting clash resolution After one-on-one meetings with different team members, there was a gradual shift in their approach towards viewing the model. A bottom-up approach worked in realizing the value of BIM models. As the project was on the verge of completion, there was openness to using BIM during construction as a coordination and visualization tool and sought appreciation by team members BIM adoption The transition from traditional construction methods to using BIM has brought a revolution among all the project stakeholders. For architects, BIM enhances their designing capability which brings refinement in design which in turn reduces unnecessary re-work. The next set of people to adopt BIM were the project owners. The benefit achieved is accuracy in estimation which in turn helped in material procurement and cost, transparency among other stakeholders of the project during coordination and construction was key for the owners to adopt BIM. In due time contractors and other stakeholders observed the efficient gains from BIM adoption. They are today the biggest proponents of BIM and this gives them the ability to build faster, smarter, reduce errors and wastages and eliminated unbudgeted problems.

TRADITIONAL WAY OF FACILITY MANAGEMENT In the traditional method, the facility management team gets a set of documents includingas-built drawings, 2D plans, specifications, manuals, and perhaps a 3D building model at completion for facility operation and maintenance. But, many times, the documents are incomplete and so hard to understand. Moreover, they may not be compatible with FM software. If the information is uninformed into a record model of the as-built facility using the3D building models for design, analysis, construction planning, 4D coordination, and fabrication, this model can support the day-to-day operations and planning. Thus the facility management team can ensure reliable and efficient operation. RISE OF NEW GENERATION SYSTEM  BIM The solution to the common issues in FM is a new generation of systems and processes, which is calledBuilding Information Modeling (BIM). BIM is not a mere drawing and labeling tool like a CAD system. There are many tools, processes, and methodologies in this new system. As it provides a three-dimensional representation of a building with all database storage mechanisms for properties about every element of the building, it is beneficial for everybody in the industry including architecture, engineers, constructors, etc. Even though the migration fromCAD to BIMmay take time and effort, the benefits are many like tome-savings, cost, and information retention. EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF 6D BIM IN FM BIM facilitates increased teamwork and collaboration during the design and construction stage. It also results in significant cost reduction and dramatic productivity increase. BIM can also influence facility management at a big level. Facility management includes many things like asset management and allocation, facility maintenance and operation, etc. BIM can present a simple centralized facility management data solution in a relational database. It links 3D geometric building data to its function and uses and thus eliminates redundant information. As-Built Modeling As-built BIM model documents the built reality. We can maintain the model updated during construction by incorporating design modifications. The as-built BIM model is used as a basis for6D technical facility management, as it helps to include all the necessary data for management tools in the building service model. Since it helps exactly position conducts, pipes, devices, and other elements, it saves time and materials. As-built Modeling helps identify existing construction materials and structural elements as well as the exact positioning of devices like pipes and conducts. So it is also time and resource-saving assisting inproject management and alteration works. 6D real estate managementallows all types of operations and the exact positioning of spaces and their characteristics. IMPORTANCE OF AS-BUILT MODEL FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT The updates as built BIM model is a valuable resource for facility managers. It is an efficient tool for controlling operation and maintenance tasks. It provides all important information about building service components including serial numbers, model names, tech sheets, warranties, maintenance manuals, schedules and service logs, etc. BIM models can also be constructed from the existing, as-built models. Even though there is no as-built record, we can easily capture dimensional information using 3D laser scanning devices and convert them fromScan to BIM. Several facility managers use this method to capture as-built information and create a BIM model.

Besides, the construction industry is responsible for 39% of global carbon emissions. By 2025, the annual construction waste is expected to reach 2.2 billion tons globally. So how do we tackle this inevitable crisis that stems from unmanaged construction waste? A possible measure is to use innovative solutions like Building Information Model (BIM), and prefabrication and modular construction across small-and-large scale projects. Modular prefabricated construction means constructing components of the building structure off-site and later transporting these components to the construction site for assembly. For example, the floors, walls and panels are constructed off-site and later installed together at the construction site. Prefabrication and modular construction have been a great boon to the US AEC industry. The COVID crisis has pushed the industry to adopt technology that can help us overcome manpower shortage, construction costs and supply-chain issues in construction. Together with 3D BIM models, modular construction can ensure shorter project duration, enhanced resource management, better product quality and more importantly reduced construction waste. Lets find out how: ? When it comes to prefabrication, the off-site construction and the use of technologies such as 3D printing require fewer materials and yet deliver better quality. The left-over material, if any, is reused in-house thus avoiding construction waste dumped in landfills. ? Building Information Modeling or BIM helps designers and other construction stakeholders visualize and gauge the dimensions and location of prefabricated components. The digital construction allows the project team members to estimate the quantity and location of the components and help them decide elements that require prefabrication. ? The design stage becomes easier with precise calculations of building elements and area measurements. Besides, this detailed information assists project stakeholders in identifying the number of resources required for the project. This, in turn, decreases construction waste. For example, structural steel, metal studs and electrical panel with pre-cut wires as per required length, roofing with panels, ceiling light with the prewired metal jacket are some of the building elements that can be prefabricated off-site as per the design requirement. Heres a case study of an apartment building built using BIM and modular construction that will help us see this in application. Can we mention the case study as a reference? The apartment building has a combination of metal and brick panel facades. It has five levels of apartments with wooden frames and two levels of concrete retail/office/common spaces and one-level underground parking. The entire project spans across an area of 2,41,070 square feet including the underground parking. The BIM implementation plan was for the architectural design. Vertical framing had standard dimensions (8 feet). Frames around the windows had standardized dimensions as well. As a result, the studs were ordered as per the required length and even the dry wall had a standard size. With the help of BIM, the electrical contractor retrieved information on wire length for each outlet. The electrical break panels, could therefore be, delivered directly on-site with connected wires. On-site, the contractor had to simply use the wire to the outlet. Also, the electrical metal cladding was pre-cut off-site. This avoided the use of excess wiring and metal cladding. Similarly, in the case of plumbing, elbows fitting, spools cutting and other waste line PVC related jobs were prefabricated at the plumbing contractors shop. The plumbing parts were later fixed together on-site. With this off-site prefabrication, it was possible to cut most spools out of the same 20-feet piping material, thus saving piping materials. The BIM coordination, construction planning, use of prefabricated framings, electrical and plumbing works helped in reducing on-site construction waste. Besides, the use of standardized dimensions and cutting construction materials at the shop lowered the number of packing materials that were brought to the construction site. Prefabrication jobs also led to less waste at the construction site and thus required fewer laborers to remove the waste and fewer dump trucks to dispose of the waste. To sum it up, we cannot avoid construction waste. However, we can reduce construction waste by the efficient use of innovative technologies. BIM and modular construction technologies not only speed up the building process, help save time and costs, but also lower the environmental impact. This only makes it a win-win situation for all of us in the construction industry!

According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2020, ""women make up about 10.3% of the construction industry workforce"". This percentage has remained relatively consistent for nearly ten years, with women representing 9-10% of the industry's workforce since 2010. A Management Today 2020 report mentions that only 5% of senior managers in the UK construction industry are women. The percentage of women in the construction industry workforce is comparatively lower, but it is essential to look at the related reasons and trends to be able to anticipate their growth in the industry in the future.  Why should women choose the construction industry? Let us explore some of the benefits of why women should consider a career in construction: Career growth:?The construction industry offers ample career growth and development opportunities. Women can move up the ranks and take on leadership positions, eventually becoming CEOs or senior executives.? Growing demand: The construction industry is experiencing a growing demand for skilled workers as global population growth and urbanization drive the need for new infrastructure and housing. This means ample opportunities exist for women to enter the industry and build rewarding careers.? High earning potential: As per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2020, ""the median annual wage for women working in construction occupations was $41,220, which is higher than the median annual wage for women in administrative and support roles ($38,180) and education, training, and library occupations."" Job satisfaction: The construction industry can provide immense job satisfaction as it involves working on diverse projects that significantly impact the built environment. Working in construction can give a sense of accomplishment and pride in the tangible results of their work. The potential for equal opportunities: With more women entering the construction industry in the past few years, there is a growing emphasis on equal opportunities. This has led to more job openings and greater flexibility in working hours, making it easier for women to balance their work and personal lives. What are the barriers faced by women in the construction industry? Women have historically been underrepresented despite the benefits of working in the construction industry. Even now, women must overcome several challenges to move up the ladder in the construction industry. Some of the critical barriers include the following: Gender bias: The construction industry has traditionally been male-centric, and gender bias and stereotypes persist. Women may face discrimination in hiring and promotions and may be looked at as less competent or less dedicated to their careers than their male counterparts.? Pay gap:?Like many other industries, the construction industry, too, has a gender pay gap. According to a National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC) report, ""the gender pay gap is significantly smaller in construction occupations, with women earning on average 95.5 percent of what men make"". Lack of mentorship and representation: Women may need more role models and mentors in the industry, making navigating career paths and building networks easier. Without visible representation in leadership roles, it can be difficult for women to envision themselves in positions typically managed by men. Physical demands and safety concerns: Some jobs in the construction industry require physical strength, which might hinder women who may face physical limitations. Additionally, some women might worry about the safety protocols on the work sites.  What are some of the leadership strategies for women in construction? Here are some leadership strategies for women in the construction industry: Communicate well and confidently lead: They should believe in their abilities and knowledge and not fear failure. Confidence can help them gain credibility among their team and coworkers. Communication is central to effective leadership; they must listen carefully, express their ideas clearly, and be open to feedback. Set goals and delegate: Women must set clear, measurable goals for themselves and their teams. This can help them stay focused and motivated and ensure that they are making progress. Women in leadership positions should delegate responsibilities, allowing the leaders more time to focus on high-level activities.? Seek training and development opportunities:?Continued education and training can help women develop new skills and stay current on industry trends. They could find themselves a good mentor as it's a great way to build leadership skills.?  The construction industry has traditionally been male-dominated, but that is changing. With more women entering the industry and taking on leadership roles, there is a growing recognition that gender diversity is essential for the industry's success. It can be improved through mentorship programs, recruitment efforts targeted toward women, and training to eliminate bias.  Are you interested in reading more about the BIM& construction industry?

However, there is a common misconception among contractors that technologies like BIM are only beneficial to multi-billion-dollar corporations. But, the truth is that smaller construction firms get more benefits out of these opportunities if they use them properly. People think that BIM is actually useful only for designers and engineers and not for contractors. There is also a misbelief that implementing BIM is very expensive. But what they have to understand is that the benefits out of BIM are depended on how efficiently they use them. HOW WILL BIM BENEFIT YOUR PROCESS THE MOST? The first step is to analyze how BIM will benefit your process the most. Once the hand-drawn concrete drawings are prepared, the process can be automated using BIM technology. As theBIM Modeling servicescan be used for field utilization, the contractors can ensure improved labor productivity significantly. Moreover, the BIM-based drawings provide information about quantities of concrete and the time taken for construction. In short, the efficiently prepared drawings will help the superintendents to spend their time more efficiently at work that will result in saving time and money. BIM IMPLEMENTATION  WHATS THE PROCESS? The implementation plan is the second step in this process in which you have to decide how you will utilize this technology on a consistent basis. BIM offers not only a 3D Modeling tool but also a solution for access, storage, and use of information. So, while you are working on a concrete BIM Modeling project, you have to identify the steps and process flow in that. Then you can decide how to use BIM model efficiently throughout the process. If the contractors develop BIM templates, family components, and intelligent objects within BIM models besides a drawing, they can provide you vital information about quantities, productivity goals, schedule analysis, manpower, and more. Here is a live example of how Excelize assisted its client with BIM Modeling and clash detection services helping them in saving time: For an IT building spread over4 floors and an area of7,40,00 sq. ft. We worked on building architectural BIM Modeling,Structural BIM Modeling, andMEP BIM servicescomponents. These models were used forclash detection and resolution(CDR).By using the model CDR phase of the project was completed in one month as compared to 3 months for CDR with the conventional process. Similarly, each and every phase of building information Modeling would add to the return on investment to the owner and user as well. Whether its BIM Modeling services of various disciplines, MEP BIM coordination, clash detection and resolution,4D BIM schedulingor cost estimation, BIM offers its users a return on investment at every phase of BIM process cycle. WHAT ARE THE COMMON HURDLES FACED WHILE IMPLEMENTING BIM? Contractors generally fear about the possible obstacles faced while BIM implementation for the first time in their organization. To solve these issues is the next step. The common problem is that the field staff is not confident about the ability of the computer or they are reluctant to learn the technology. So, the appropriate team should be found out within the company, who can use this solution in the beginning to solve this issue. A superintendent and project manager with an open mind to this technology, can manage the BIM-based project successfully and spread the idea to other superintendents. WHAT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED DURING BIM IMPLEMENTATION PHASES? The next step is to find out the infrastructure necessary to begin the implementation process. First priority goes to sufficient manpower. Technicians, who have experience in the construction field are essential. Moreover, MEP modelers, who come from the trades, can bring their field experience to the Modeling team. The most important thing is that the employees should be given proper training to understand the new technology at every level. The technicians in most of the firms are of the younger generation. The company should arrange opportunities for them to work with experienced personnel, as it will result in a perfect blend of technology and construction application. Another significant element is the requirement of high-performing hardware and software with a RAM of a minimum of 32 GB. You have to find a good amount of the annual budget for installing and updating hardware and software may require a larger investment.

CAD is an acronym for Computer-Aided Design, which designers use to develop floor plans for buildings, layouts for numerous purposes such as landscaping, control plans, and plans in general. 2D CAD Drafting is a method that has been used from the days of old, replacing complicated technical drawings via pen and paper. Its a revolutionary way to design whatever you like without the need for stencils, and instruments, and with some room for error. Another perk of 2D CAD Services is the flexibility of the program itself. It allows you to add annotations to anything you like and improve your design without the need to do it all over again. You can add as much or as little information and data to your 2D technical scheme with ease. 3D CAD Modeling The next step in the evolution of 2D CAD Drafting is 3D CAD Modeling. This newer technology allows the user to do everything they could with 2D CAD Drafting but add a 3D rendering aspect to the project itself. A 3D model is a part file you create in your program so that you can print it later! A 3D file is a model along with the co-responding environment youve placed it in. The focus is on the point. There are two different types of 3D models, and they are used to create two different things. Solid Model A solid model is a model youve created within your 3D modeling program, that is used to determine analytics data of the model youre trying to create. Think of it as the most realistic representation of your finished product stats. These models are used to acquire and analyze the data of your finished product, such as its capabilities and flaws you can improve on. Surface Model Surface models are another type of model youve created with your 3D modeling program and are mostly used to represent the shell of your object. They are used to fine-tune the appearance of the model itself and closely represent how the model will look when its created. Which one is better? Well, the answer to this question depends on your needs. What you are looking for will determine which method or program is better for you, and well help you find out your needs right here! While most PCs can run 2D CAD Drafting without any issue, to use 3D CAD modeling, you have to invest in a higher performance machine. Another question that comes to mind is, why do you need to use said programs? You dont have to use 3D CAD modeling if youre looking to create something simple, although you can. 3D CAD services are more advanced  there are no doubts about that. But with its perks, it also brings more requirements. You dont have to employ 3D CAD Modeling if youre working with layers, line types, and line weights. A big perk of 3D CAD modeling is that its simple to present to someone. If someone is not a technician, the chances that they will understand a 2D CAD drawing are very scarce. But with a 3D Object, they can easily navigate and observe  youre most likely to get a positive response. Why is this useful, you might ask? The answer is simple! If youre trying to get something approved, the process is much quicker if the person approving it can understand what theyre shown. Its much easier to present an object than a technical drawing. Youve made an error, oh no! Dont worry! Editing anything with 3D technology is an absolute breeze. You need to locate it, fix it with a few strokes of your mouse, and its over with. Using 2D drawing technology, the process is much more tedious. Just locating the problem is a problem in itself and redrawing the whole thing could be a nightmare. 2D drawings are for technical purposes only. The visualization of 2D drawings cant be used for marketing purposes, as people who understand what they are viewing are either competition or very scarce. Showing functionality through this method is tough. 3D drawings are visually orientated, so visualization is an easy task to accomplish. They can be used for marketing purposes and show how an object will react and compete in a real-life and real-time situation. Showing functionality through this method is unavoidable. So, to finally answer the question of which method is better, well list some pros and cons of each one. Based on this information, we leave the realization to you. Pros of 2D CAD Drafting Its far cheaper than 3D CAD modeling, so its a very cost-effective alternative to 3D CAD modeling. Learning the ins and outs of 2D CAD drafting is simple, and you can find your way around the program with no problem. Formatting is simple, as you are working with. DWG extensions exclusively. Sharing your information and data with others is an absolute breeze, and you dont have to worry about compatibility issues. Cons of 2D CAD Drafting Its a bit too simple. Even if you can create 3D models through this method, the program itself does not allow you to visualize your creations. Editing is a nightmare. Repetitive and tedious tasks such as redrawing and trimming paths and lines can take up a lot of time that could be used to create better models and drawings. Creating 3D models, even if you cant visualize them at all is a straining task, and requires a lot more effort. Pros of 3D CAD Modeling 3D CAD modeling is used to create 3D models easily. Every 3D model created has an automatic 2D rendering, so youre killing two birds with one stone. Editing is easy and takes a little time out of your workday, giving you more time to work on the model itself. 3D CAD modeling, although more advanced, can be simpler than 2D CAD drafting at times. Its much more user and consumer-friendly. The user interaction with 3D CAD modeling is simple, as the person looking at the design can observe it in a real-life simulation. Making perks and additions is as simple as one two three. Cons of 3D CAD Modeling The only cons of 3D CAD modeling boil down to the hardware that is required to run the software itself. There arent any advantages of using 2D if 3D technology is available. 3D is an assertive and impressive thing to present to your clients, and its a simple way to create whatever youre striving to create, present, or sell. Therefore it's always advisable to get professional help from companies like Back office Pro Company for proper 2D and 3D CAD services for your requirements.

My interactions with the extremely talented students there were energizing for me personally. In the time since that visit to Ahmedabad, Ive been thinking about the discussions I had. I realized that there were some common threads with the interactions that I have had previously with architecture students in other places too. If we look at the world of architecture pragmatically, an architect's ultimate aim is to turn his or her vision into reality. For this, stalwarts like Frank Lloyd Wright used 2D and pencil drafting for designing their masterpieces. Frank Gehry, on the other hand, used 3D modeling tools. The objective was the same. The path to reach them was different. The past couple of decades have seen such a proliferation of technology that now we can hardly imagine a world without tech. Whatever we do, technology seems to come up with a better way, or at least an easier and more convenient way, of doing things. Clearly, nothing has made a more defining impact on the everyday lives of the people as technology. The world of architecture is no different and technology has fundamentally changed the way we do things. In my career in architecture which spans over 25 years, Ive benefited from adopting technology much of the time. Over that span, Ive gone from 2D AutoCAD to using 3D modeling tools. I can claim that I have been an active witness to the benefits that technology brings to architectural design. When it comes to the construction industry, we can see the immense progress this industry has made. Once upon a time, this industry wouldnt be seen as the space that lent itself easily to new-age, disruptive technology. Time has proven otherwise. Today, there are a multitude of options being employed by this industry to speed up project execution as there are a plethora of options in building materials. Construction technology is being employed extensively to not only drive sustainability but also make project management and execution smoother and more streamlined. Extensive research is driving the emergence of new building materials such as self-healing concrete to reflective self-cooling paint. Modular and pre-fabrication (prefab) construction methods are being employed to produce buildings in lesser time and technologies such as BIM (Building Information Modelling) are helping the industry with better planning and design, reduced costs of errors, prefabrication support, and savings on materials. I have come to believe that most students struggle to resolve two dilemmas - first, does form follow function or function follow form? The other oneis architecture an artistic science or a scientific art? I believe we need to add one more question to this list  Does technology aid creativity or kill it? With the wave of change coming across in this industry, I feel that the education system needs to keep pace with the pace of technology adoption. We, therefore, need to enable students to explore new design tools which aid visualization. While creating an aesthetic edifice is essential it is equally important to make students aware of all the technology options that can play a role in making the design executable and operational. This holistic approach can perhaps be emphasized more in todays architectural education, more so at the undergrad level. My interaction with the students of construction technology and management at CEPT threw light on what they are learning at an academic level. While the course content is quite comprehensive, I feel that continuously tying up academic knowledge to real-world examples will keep such courses fresh and relevant, especially since technology applications keep expanding. Talking about using technology to understand what happens after the design is done is a good starting point. However, we also need to consider how to employ technology to hasten execution and ensure that the same is done within defined timeframes. We need to evaluate how to use technology to eliminate or at least reduce wastage  of time, effort, and of materials, and ensure that projects are completed within the allocated budgets. We need to start evaluating how technology can be used to maintain these aspects during the project lifecycle. Students also need to know that the operations and maintenance costs of any building are more than double the design and construction costs. They would do well to work on identifying ways to keep this in check. Technologies such as Facilities Management Solutions and BIM are of great utility here. They can help us realize how to efficiently operate a building and understand that such effects can only be unleashed when construction is done keeping those methods in mind right from the drawing board stage. Using technology, we can build without guesswork and with clear and specific data. Clearly, with the plethora of technology tools available today, we are at an advantage as we can analyze building performance over its lifecycle. And what, I feel, is really pertinent in todays day of stringent timelines and faster execution is the ability to build virtually before we start building physically. My advice to architecture students would thus be to look at technology and the various technology options, available and emerging, to assess how to build better, build faster, and build without wastage. They must assess how and where technology can be adopted to bring about change in the entire building ecosystem for greater sustainability.

The USA is also home to the worlds largest construction industry with a workforce of over 10 million people. It wont be wrong to say that the construction industry is one of the pillars providing strength to the American economy. Every year, projects worth $1.3 trillion are undertaken. The stats are impressive, but perhaps, the reality is not all as rosy. Even though the US has the worlds largest construction industry, construction has become a challenging business to win in. 1. Slow growth rate and low-profit margins One of the biggest challenges faced by the construction industry in 2019 is the decline in the profit margins. This is said to be a result of the burgeoning interest rates and equipment rental costs. The construction industry has long depended on debt. In fact, the meagre borrowing costs after the Great Recession encouraged companies to fuel expansion with new debt. The trend carried through and became a norm. High corporate debt stands at $9 trillion today. The construction industry, more than most, faces the challenge of serving massive debt numbers. Add to that a decline in demand. Theres a case to be made that after the boom in multi-family housing, followed by commercial building, the current focus on public infrastructure projects portends a coming construction slowdown. In fact, a survey by the Wall Street Journal predicts that the US economy could experience another bout of recession in 2020. 2. Adoption and integration of technology Businesses across sectors are fast turning into technology businesses, but the construction industry, across the globe, still seems to largely rely upon traditional methods, and the US is no different. According to a survey by JB Knowledge, 39% of the surveyed correspondents cited the lack of IT staff as the biggest limiting factor in adopting more technology. This inability to adopt the latest technology means is impairing the ability of construction companies to dramatically drive up efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and impact. This reflects in the results too. While the construction sector has managed to improve productivity by only 1% in the last 20 years, other sectors of the economy have seen productivity gains of three-times as much! 3. Lack of skilled labour The JB Knowledge survey also found that a meagre 24% of the construction employees were comfortable with the idea of adopting new technology, and only 11% of general contractors are using wearable technology. The future will be driven by technology. The construction industry wont be immune to these changes. The inability to find trained and skilled labour will result in a failure of adopting new technological methods, thereby denting the profit prospects of a company and industry at large. Of course, the labour shortage is not in the futuristic areas alone. Even in the traditional construction roles, positions are proving hard to fill. The Associated General Contractors of America estimate that as many as 79% of companies in the space need to hire more people. 4. Increase in cost of materials The global cost of construction materials has grown around 9% since the last year. This has also pushed up overall construction costs by as much as 6.2%. The demand-supply parity has made construction companies run from pillar to post to make ends meet. The increased costs result in low profitability. Several uncontrolled external factors dent the profits margin along with some controllable internal factors that companies often overlook. Poor estimation of raw material quantities, over and under-ordering, and losses under storage cause lower profit margins. Inaccurate estimates also add to increased logistics cost and delays in construction. How can BIM help in overcoming the challenges? A lot has been said and written about the pros and cons of adopting BIM technology in the construction industry. The UK construction industry is considered the hotbed of BIM technology. As per an NBS report, BIM adoption saw a staggering rise from 14% in 2012 to 74% in the year 2018. The estimated savings on the initial prototype projects was calculated to be around 2.5% of the total lifetime cost. The BIM Level 2 mandate has helped the UK government in curtailing the cost for public assets by 20%. The UK government is said to have saved $2.1 billion since the BIM mandate. Theres no doubt that BIM works. That said, BIM is often reduced to a 3D model drawing of a building. But it is far more than just that. BIM is a centralized source of information for all the involved parties. It helps in avoiding the duplication of information along with providing real-time access to accurate information. This reduces the scope of errors due to unavailability of information, eliminates waste, and removes the possibility of time and energy lost due to clashes. This can drive higher productivity and faster project completion. This can help companies get more done with the resources at hand. Better estimation of costs and raw materials is another critical feature of BIM technology that helps in curtailing construction costs. The 3D model lets the builders derive a certain quantity of the required raw materials. A change in design automatically reflects in the amounts estimated. This feature helps in avoiding over or under-procurement of the raw materials. This helps drive improved financial performance and more efficient working. Wrapping Up The construction industry, just like any other industry, keeps evolving. Every day brings in a new challenge. But the future of the world is technology, and any industry that refuses to adapt to technological advancement will find it hard to break free of the shackles that have always held it down. Dramatic changes demand the adoption of disruptive technologies. Its come to that time for the construction industry in the USA.

This is prompting governments to increase funding. Based on the data provided by IBEF in this regards, the government of India has significantly raised its stakes in the infrastructure sector. This includes the construction of highways, urban transport, and renewable energy among others. As a part of its initiatives, some crucial announcements were made in the Union Budget 2019-20. These include the allocation of: Rs 4.56 lakh crore (US$ 63.20 billion) for the infrastructure sector. Rs 83,015.97 crore (US$11.51 billion) towards road transport and highway. Rs 8,350.00 crore (US$ 1.16 billion) to boost telecom infrastructure. These are huge numbers. But the question that remains is  how can the country get the maximum impact from this budget overlay on infrastructure? As I had already mentioned in one of my earlier posts, I believe that the government needs to make BIM mandatory in all public infrastructure projects for a variety of important reasons. These benefits can also be tied to generating better outcomes from budget outlays. That being said, here are some of the concrete steps that the government could take in this regard. Get a Flawless Financial Management Plan Despite eProcurement appearing in pockets, tender bids are still commonplace in government infrastructure projects in India. These are largely needed for large-scale projects. To ensure the sanctity of these bids, the tenders need to be based on accurate estimates of both material and labor costs. This is where the government could come up with a flawless financial model by using a BIM and ERP combo. That will help derive much more accurate estimations for all the significant items in the BOM and the efforts needed to deliver the project. Cut Down Planning and Estimate Creation Times BIM adoption will also lead to cutting down the time needed to create a plan or an estimate. Compare this with traditional methods, which rely on excel sheets, manual calculations, CAD drawings, and so on. This could lead to adding 60-70% extra time at this stage itself. Delays in planning can lead to project delays, cost escalations, and material procurement issues. With precise and timely plans and estimates generated faster, it may become easier to achieve project completion faster. Identify and Highlight Unbudgeted Changes Unforeseen costs and on-the-fly project changes can lead the budgets to go off the rails. To avoid such situations, BIM can prove handy as it paves the way for precise information collation in near-real-time. With the most current information at its disposal, the government agencies can work towards making go or no-go decisions about the changes. If a tweak or change is necessary, it can be visible early enough to make it easy to do. If its not required, then it can be stopped or discarded before it consumes too many resources. Generate More Opportunities for Sustainable Energy Consumption By leveraging BIM, the government can leave age-old construction methods behind. They can adopt more modern, and hence more efficient, construction methods that rely on the data that BIM will provide. For instance, they can adopt Artificial Intelligence to drive greater operational efficiency and longevity. BIM models could help drive more sustainable construction practices. BIM information could help drive a more realistic design and efficient ongoing maintenance of the structure. This construction process simulation in advance can help them achieve sustainable energy consumption. All these roads lead to savings! Avoid Clash Detection by Assessing Risks This is fundamental to BIM. The many benefits of BIM for any construction project would apply for large government projects too -but at an immensely greater scale. The many teams on the project can collaborate better by relying on BIM. This is useful in avoiding clash detection. It can help plan schedules better. BIM can help optimize material procurements. All that helps deliver more bang for the budget buck. Focus on Information Flow It's not hard to imagine how difficult it is for various teams on the construction project when they constantly have to deal with incomplete bits and pieces of information. How would they plan? How would they schedule? How would they ensure wastage is reduced? This is where BIM comes to their rescue. Crisp information flow with precise project designs in-sync with the time these crucial tasks must begin can drive major savings. Theres no doubt that BIM is a powerful tool that can help the government to deliver state-of-the-art infrastructure projects. I have said often that I would like the government of India to take a cue from the UK, where the government started enforcing a BIM mandate actively a couple of years ago. Estimates are that this has enabled them to save up to 15% to 20% on the costs of public construction projects, i.e from 2009 through 2015, an estimated saving of around $1 Billion. In government projects, the focus must be on delivering the maximum impact at the most reasonable cost and within the most appropriate time.

The real estate sector is one of the key contributors to the UAEs economy besides tourism. UAE is an exquisite amalgamation of heritage and modern construction. The infrastructural revolution in the UAE was the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who wanted to bring the worlds attention to his country. He did it and how! Looking at the number of iconic buildings in the UAE, theres a lot one can learn from some of the worlds most significant construction projects. Here are some magnificent structures in the UAE that we can all learn from. Burj Khalifa It would be unjust to begin with any other building than the Burj Khalifa  the tallest structure ever to be built on the earth! The Burj Khalifa stands at a staggering height of 828m and is located in the city of Dubai. The structure was built over 6 years from January 2004 to January 2010 when it was first opened to visitors. The exterior of the structure was completed in October 2009. The structure created 15 world records, some of which are unlikely to be broken soon. Overview of the structure: The structure is spread over an area of 2,80,000 sqm 165 floors above grade level and 3 floors basement area. 2,50,000 cubic meter of concrete was used 39,000 tonnes of steel rebars were used 22 million working hours were invested in the construction of the structure The biggest challenge while attempting to build the tallest building in the world was to understand and control the dynamics of wind effect while designing the massive structure. In inspiring fashion, the design team integrated wind engineering principles to mitigate the impact of wind as the structure rose higher. The team planned on diminishing the width and shape of the structure as it spiraled higher into the sky, thereby cutting down the wind dynamic effects, movement and acceleration. The desert lily inspired the design of Burj Khalifa. The Y-shaped base was designed to provide stability to the building while keeping in mind the direction of wind and source of light. The lower floors up to 108 are used for residential and hotel space since it provides a 360-degree view of the surroundings with ample natural light. Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal Abu Dhabi  the capital of UAE, is expected to have an inflow of over 20 million passengers in the next two years. The Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal is one of the largest infrastructure works going on in the city today. The terminal is located between the two existing runways at the Abu Dhabi International Airport and thats why it is named as Midfield Terminal. The new terminal is a part of Abu Dhabis 2030 project of reshaping and positioning the city as a tourist hub. In a significant move, the authorities mandated the use of BIM while issuing the tender for the Midfield Terminal. The project has immensely benefitted with the use of integrated BIM services. The terminal is designed in an X shape, which is believed to reduce the passenger walking time and maximizing aircraft parking space. The key features of the project: The MTF has 7,42,000 sqm of floor space The terminal can handle 8,500 passengers every hour It s expected to serve 84 million passengers per year The designers claim that minimum connecting time for international passengers will be 45 minutes from gate to gate The MTF houses the worlds largest indoor arch  180m long and 52m high The terminal will have 65 gates out of which 8 gates are equipped to host A380 aircraft The terminal capitalizes on natural light making it an energy-efficient structure Palm Jumeirah Palm Jumeirah is one of the three archipelagoes under Dubais Palm Islands project. It is the largest man-made artificial archipelago in the world. In many ways, Dubai and UAE were put on the global real estate map in 2007 when the final breakwater stone was laid. The project was unique and perceived to be unthinkable due to the construction challenges posed by the location of the islands. It was an ambitious project that worked for Dubai and the UAE. The construction of Palm Jumeirah began in 2001 and the first phase of the project was completed in just six years. Palm Jumeirah opened its gate to the world in 2007. Nakheel, the developer, said that the material used to build the Palm was enough to create a 2m high and 0.5m wide wall that would run around the world three times! Now, imagine the challenges of constructing such a site. The lesson from the project was that even as ambition rose, skills, technique, and technology can help achieve even those rarified heights. Key features of the project: Use of more than 1 billion cubic meters of sand  the most used in any construction project in the world. 7 million tonnes of rocks were used. The Crescent is a large rock breakwater created to protect the islands. The breakwater is lined with around seven million tons of rocks which were individually placed by a crane after being approved by a diver based on GPS coordinates. The design of the crescent was modified after the completion of land reclamation. The closed crescent resulted in obstructed water circulation which caused stagnant water between the fronds. The crescent was modified to have two openings to allow the water to circulate between the fronds. Dubai Frame In February 2018, Dubai added another feather to its cap with the Dubai frame. It is the largest photo frame in the world. The frame stands between the old and the new city. Tourists can enjoy a 360-degree view of both the parts of the cities from the frame. The structure comprises 50 stories and is built of glass, steel, and aluminum. The ground level consists of a museum with 3D exhibits of Dubais history along with a future gallery that provides a sneak-peak of the city in 2050 making it a perfect amalgamation of the past, the present, and the future.The structure offers a uniquely Dubai inspiration on how to bring together the innovative and the historical in a perfectly functional manner. Key features of the structure: The frame is 150m high with a 93m long sky deck. The 116 sqm switchable smart-glass panels on the floor of the bridge turn transparent from translucent as visitors walk by. 2,900 sqm of laminated glass was used. It took 4 giant hydraulic jacks and two days to raise the central bridge. 9,900 cubic meter of concrete was used in the construction along with 2,000 tonnes of steel. Expected to have 200 visitors per hour. The Capital Gate The Capital Gate, also called the leaning tower of Abu Dhabi, holds the Guinness World Record for The Worlds Furthest Leaning Man Made Tower. The tower is an architectural marvel with an eighteen degrees lean westwards. The design was inspired by the world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. The Capital Gate leans four times more than its design inspiration in a stunning lesson on how to learn from the past and then push the envelope far far beyond that. Key features of the structure: The building sits on 490 piles drilled 30m under the ground to accommodate the gravitational, seismic, and wind forces due to the lean. The tower is built upon dense mesh and reinforced steel The tower is 160m high and has 35 stories. The tower houses Hyatt Capital Gate Abu Dhabi The free form internal atrium dynamic glass roof allows natural light deep inside the tower Advanced diagrid technology was used to construct the intricate design The reinforced basement of the tower was built with 6,000 cubic meters of concrete 21,500 tonnes of steel was used for constructing the tower The UAE is home to some mesmerizing architectural structures. Even upcoming infrastructural projects look set to ensure that the UAE stays on the global real estate map as the country with the most iconic structures. Theres much for the construction sector to learn from these iconic structures, their scale, ambition, and technology. The lessons look set to continue.

Could BIM and IoT combination change the world of construction? Building Information Modeling has now gained widespread acceptance in representing the information inherent within drawings and plans. But it lacks something at the post-construction and operation stage. Post-construction the model does not represent the structure as a living element, it only represents the as-built form of the building. Even during the construction, the BIM model is only as good as the information provided to it. If the data is late or inaccurate, the model will be too. In this context, an integration between BIM and IoT could be utilized to have better construction and development monitoring, crisis management, energy management, and ongoing functioning. Lets explore how this could work. First, some definitions to set a baseline. Building Information Modelling (BIM): We all know what BIM is. In our context, lets assume that BIM includes combining information to create a digital representation of a project. This suggests integrating information from numerous sources and evolving in parallel with the real project over the whole course of events. This evolution would cover design, construction, and development. Of course, BIM adds value across the entire lifecycle of a project by providing coordinated and validated data that everyone can access and share. No need to make the widely accepted case that BIM helps in lowering costs, improving, improving productivity and profitability, saving time, and improving operational management. Internet of things (IoT): An ongoing revolution of the IT age, IoT is the network of things, with clear component identification, embedded with software intelligence, sensors, and connectivity to a network (usually the internet). IoT focuses on establishing communication between all these devices. The objective of IoT is to enable the far reaches of any ecosystem (like buildings or structures) with the capability of gathering data, sharing it with a platform that can process it and derive intelligent insights, and take actions based on those insights. BIM integration with IoT -the possibilities: Integrating BIM with IoT nodes could provide various advantages, some of which are listed below: More efficient BIM: One of the most significant values of using BIM is collaboration. But there are some obstacles influencing the ability to collaborate with project teams, one of which is closed data. Limiting access to data that should be shared, makes BIM processes difficult to streamline. Integration with IoT could make BIM processes more effective by providing them with a steady stream of reliable information.  Ubiquitous Monitoring: The building elements can be considered as things that provide data about their own state. Through ubiquitous monitoring, the information about the building elements can be provided continuously, even in an emergency situation. This can have wide implications, including in safety and project communications.  Resource Management: BIM has tremendous utility in resource planning and tracking. Material estimates can be made much more efficiently by turning to BIM models. BY combining that estimate with IoT, the BIM models can also get ongoing feedback about resource usage in real-time. This will help fine-tune the models and make them even more effective at predicting the material requirements. This will also help control material wastage and loss from the site and provide a much more accurate record of utilization.  Client-Independent Architecture: As construction becomes more tech-focused, the project sites start depending more on software applications. In that ecosystem, the data acquired from BIM models can be displayed, visualized, and analyzed by any application. This information can be immeasurably enriched by integrating with IoT. The information gathered from the IoT nodes such as temperature, humidity, state of the building, information regarding danger of fire and flood, and the state of air conditioning systems and elevators and escalators can be made available for interested parties regardless of their operating system and the software they use. This can bridge the key technologies for acquiring and presenting real-time structured data.  HumanBuilding Interaction: By integrating IoT nodes with BIM, the structures can provide information about their state. This information can either be provided continuously or on request. The provision of data on demand by the structure elements, when integrated with the IoT can prove advantages. There are significant benefits in Facilities Management. This can help drive up the efficiency of maintenance activities by making them pre-emptive or proactive. This concept, when implemented, can help shift buildings to becoming automated or intelligent buildings. Building Information Modelling has already reformed the construction industry. The core element in BIM is data and having a collaborative connection between each part of the project. That suggests that the way to evolve BIM is to make it a real-time information model. This could be done by utilizing IOT nodes to provide BIM with more updated and complete information. The BIM + IoT combination could usher in the next construction revolution.

Why smart buildings need BIM? A smart building is defined as any structure or facility that uses automated processes to control the buildings operations. The key focus is on reduction in the use of non-renewable sources of energy and relying more on renewable sources of energy thereby reducing the impact on the environment. That apart, business benefits like optimized operations, better management, reduced operational costs, and less effort can accrue. Though this definition encompasses various factors it is not restricted within these parameters. There is no single standard definition available to describe a smart building or structure in the construction and infrastructure industry. The common parameters amongst the smart structures are better resource utilization and reduced effort. Constructing a smart building involves linking the core systems of the structure such as lighting, power meters, heating, cooling, pumps, fire alarms, and plants with sensors, and easily accessible integrated control systems. The conventional structures remain just structures, unlike smart structures which could improve with time and external factors to provide more than just shelter and safety to its inhabitants. Smart Buildings & Building Information Modelling According to the experts, the future of the construction industry lies in building smart structures that will evolve with the ever-evolving technology. It is not technology alone that makes a structure smart. A smart structure is an amalgamation of technology, processes, and standards  the guiding force behind this paradigm shift in the construction and infrastructure industry today. If smart structures are the future, then one cannot overstate the importance of BIM in this endeavor. Constructing a smart building involves the integration of several different aspects that go into the construction and BIM specializes in doing that. BIM can be extremely vital in the initial stages of a project. The digital graphical representation of the facility helps in identifying and eliminating any shortcomings before beginning the construction of the facility. A building plan can be optimized with the assistance of the consolidated streamlining of data provided by the BIM software. BIM can play a crucial role in the inception, execution, construction, and maintenance of these smart buildings. Here is how: 1. Integrated Design One of the highlights of the BIM approach is the integration of data that is easily accessible to architects, engineers, designers, and builders. Every change that is made in the design gets automatically updated across the project. This helps in avoiding conflicts and gets everyone on the same page. 2. Digital Representation The graphical representation of the design in the form of a 3D model helps in understanding and thereby eradicating conflicts in the design. This is done during the inception phase which helps in avoiding loss of time and curtailing costs during the construction phase. This assists in the smart utilization of resources and in reducing wastage of time as well as materials. 3. Integrated Data The digital platform of BIM helps in centralising the data for all the involved stakeholders. It provides a single source of truth. The availability of information to every party helps in eliminating errors of judgment and miscommunication that commonly happen during large-scale construction projects. Information regarding the quantities of the required material to be procured, and estimates of proposed and current usage help in keeping a lid on over-ordering and unbudgeted expenses. 4. Security System BIM software provides a base that can be leveraged for a comprehensive and cohesive security apparatus. This can be the foundation for consolidating and generating data points with the help of smart sensors and systems installed throughout the facility. The advanced security system is not targeted to be used by the inhabitants alone. It can ensure safety during the construction period as well, by restricting unwanted maneuvering on the project site, and by assisting the management team with an overview of the activities being carried out on the site. 5. 3D Modelling 3D modelling in BIM helps in understanding not just the construction plan for a facility that we can see but also the underground construction (unseen or buried). It provides useful information to the construction team regarding existing pipelines or fiber-optic cables. The information also helps in knowing how far to dig without causing any damage to the existing underground structure. Adding in the 5D, 6D, and 7D dimensions helps to map the scale, scope, and state of construction at various project stages with respect to critical cost parameters during construction and on an ongoing basis post-construction too. This provides invaluable information for planning, execution, and management of the building. 6. Enhanced Project Visualization BIM-modelling promotes enhanced and more accurate visualization of the facility post-construction. This can become the foundation for creating management plans for the facility. This is especially critical as it captures the as-built condition of the building including providing for the changes in the plan that would have been made during the construction phase. This becomes an essential foundation to build automation strategies on. It removes the guesswork from the automation strategy and helps create a better, more comprehensive, and more tightly-integrated plan. The future is digital, and BIM is accelerating technological advancement and innovation in the construction industry. The journey to a Smart Building starts well before the construction starts - and BIM can drive that Smart journey from day one!

Mandating the use of BIM in public sector projects has saved the UK over $ 2 Billion in just 3 years. The Top 100 Contractors operate at a profitability of only 1.5%! World over, industry segment after industry segment is benefiting from adopting technology, and the construction industry has no choice but to follow suit. This is whereBuilding Information Modelling(BIM), is revolutionizing the way the construction industry works worldwide. While internationally BIM has gained mass popularity in recent times it has been around in one form or the other for years now. Even in construction projects in India, both public and private, BIM is making an impact. This post is a call to all engaged in the construction business in India to embrace BIM. But first, for those who are still unsure about what BIM is, heres a refresher. BIM is a multi-dimensional graphical representation of a construction project. It is the visual representation of the infrastructural design that highlights the physical and intrinsic features of a plan. In a very real sense, it allows one to build virtually before you have to build physically. The BIM approach helps in understanding and eliminating any issues that might arise during the construction phase. The three dimensions of BIM when married with parameters like time, cost, and the project lifecycle management create a 6-dimensional model that becomes a common frame of reference for all stakeholders. This allows the architects, engineers, and builders to plan and execute the work efficiently by eliminating or minimising likely obstacles they may face during the construction process. It facilitates sound decision making thereby making the project management efficient by curtailing the various project costs. Dr. Anil Sawhney, Associate Dean, RICS School of Built Environment has this to say,BIM adoption will be crucial for real-estate and infrastructure development in India. Increased competition, pressure on margins and stiffer regulatory environment require that we embrace BIM as it extends the capacity of the project team to start thinking about time, cost, quality, sustainability and other pragmatic parameters in the early stages of a project. Why adopt BIM? Time and money are the most critical aspects of construction or infrastructural project, and BIM helps the stakeholders  engineers, architects, and builders to work in tandem and derive an accurate estimation for both. This helps in controlling project costs and facilitates efficient project management. Here are the top 5 reasons why the Indian construction industry should adopt BIM: 1. A real view of the project A drawing on paper has its limitations which BIM surpasses by creating a real-life model of the incepted design. This real-life model helps in providing an accurate vision of how a particular building or an infrastructural design will look upon its completion. The designs carved out on paper tend to undergo modification during the construction process due to their inability to cater to the issues of the actual construction. The digital design provides much deeper insights into the nitty-gritty of carrying out the construction of the design. 2. Eliminates unbudgeted changes Building a virtual model through BIM helps in creating a single system of record that all the stakeholders subscribe to. This common understanding helps to drive all discussions and plans. That, in turn, helps in curtailing the unbudgeted changes made on-the-fly during the construction phase. The virtual model provides a practical view of the construction progress. Comparing the actual site as-built with the BIM model projected at that point in time provides a transparent data point for identifying deviations. This means that there are no last-minute changes made to the design during the construction period. This also helps in controlling construction costs due to unforeseen changes in the actual design. 3. Cost monitoring The biggest challenge in a construction project is to curtail the project cost. The project cost is dependent upon the estimation of time, quantity of materials required, and labor. We have spoken of how time can be saved with BIM. That apart, it becomes easier to control costs through the accurate estimate derived from BIM. The virtual model provides the most accurate estimations that cannot be calculated otherwise. Materials can be ordered only for the quantity required only at the time required. This eliminates wastage through over-ordering, and delays due to under-ordering, and also eliminates material loss and costs of storing on-site. 4. Streamlines work An infrastructural design is bound to see thousands of changes until the construction work is completed. Paper drawings become a hassle while trying to maintain and record the changes made to the proposed design. BIM reduces the chances of extra work or re-work. The model can be updated easily due to its digital nature. All the changes that need to be made to the actual design are instantly adapted into BIM. This record is available to everyone all the time as it is accessible to all the concerned parties. 5. Resolves potential conflicts by use of clash detection One of the significant issues to arise during construction is clashes. There are several activities that could end up getting in each others way over the process of construction. For eg. consider electrical conduit or piping going thru a beam. Such clashes can also occur with plumbing, HVAC, and other such activities too. Under normal circumstances, the only option is to redesign and re-work at a late stage in the project. The BIM model can help identify these clashes during the design process itself. This helps in saving time as schedules can be modified and plan changed to ensure that there are no clashes. Its clear that adopting and implementing BIM can smoothen the way for effective project implementation in the construction industry. This is driving BIM adoption in the developed economies of the world.

What Does It Take to Ensure Quality and Accuracy in BIM? Building Information Modeling (BIM)is a highly collaborative process for creating and managing information on a construction project across the project lifecycle. The resulting 3D building information model allows owners and stakeholders to make decisions, optimize their actions, and bring greater value for the asset. Since BIM brings together all the information in a single platform, it makes it convenient for all stakeholders to access that information forcrucial decision-making. This helps reduce mistakes, create a more effective design, and lower costs byimproving estimatesand accelerating progress. In that light, a BIM model is a crucial aspect of the construction process and so, it becomes essential to ensure quality and accuracy in BIM. Discrepancies can cause major issues during the construction process. That is why ensuring quality and accuracy in BIM becomes critical. But how to achieve accuracy and quality in BIM? Quality assurance in BIM Quality assurance of a 3D BIM model is based on a robust process of comprehensively inspecting the model system by defining areas of improvement, omissions, or mistakes. The 3D model is compared with the current drawings to ensure quality and conformance. An accurate and high-quality model is one that aligns closely with the initial BIM management plan. Accuracy in BIM Accuracy in BIM is a crucial subset of the overall quality of the model. An accurate model is the one that conforms to the best to the real situation of the construction site as it develops. These requirements may include the level of development, procedures, accuracy, and specifications of the BIM geometries. A 3D model can meet its specifications. Ensuring quality and accuracy in BIM Obviously, theres more to BIM than just a 3D model. It provides a detailed blueprint for creating and managing a construction project from start to finish. The true value of BIM starts unfolding as you add in dimensions of time, material estimates, costs, and onwards. Different teams rely on the BIM model to create their plans and schedules. Materials are ordered based on the insights derived from the model.Project management processesand reports depend on BIM. A lot is riding on this so, ensuring quality and accuracy in BIM can help streamline the process and deliver greater efficiency in every aspect of the project. But it is true that BIM adoption isnt a plug and play move. This calls forsignificant changes in the ways of working of construction companies. Rushing into BIM adoption is one of the key conditions under which BIM models end up falling short of quality and accuracy standards. Start with a pilot Rather than going directly for a big project, you can choose to work on a pilot project first. This will give you a controlled environment to learn and document your BIM usage and the challenges you face. You can nail down the typical errors and define processes to fix them. This will ensure that subsequent BIM models are of high-quality and more accurate. Create a BIM roadmap with expert assistance Having a BIM roadmap can help document all the strategic goals (short- and long-term). The roadmap can also help identify ways to leverage BIM for maximum impact. Look for areas where you need the most help with your BIM strategy and turn to experts to help you there. These experts will be able to help you deliver the initial projects, set up internal processes and systems, define the required (and necessary) quality standards, train your own people, and handhold them as the needs evolve. Your team will get to see the impact that can be achieved from high-quality and accurate BIM models and model their own efforts. Create a template for future use After the initial stages, you can reuse some aspects to create a project template. You can incorporate the non-project-specific aspects of the BIM model into your project template. You can update the model using sheet setups, project notes, and other details. Similarly, you can pick up some useful components of the model and save it in your BIM library. Having an organized BIM library can help deliver a high-quality BIM model in future projects with a solid quality base. Use plugins To achieve additional accuracy and quality, you can leverage the power of the technology. Use the available add-ons and plugins to extend the capabilities of your BIM software. Tools developed by developers are available for use for specialized tasks. This could take the model to the next level. You could also automate some specific manual tasks to reduce effort and the possibility of human errors. Validate your design There are thousands of connected pieces in buildings. Having an issue with even a small element can have a major impact on the entire building. That is why having a clear process for validating your design is a necessary step. You should also check the design assumptions in the early design phase and make the necessary corrections to the model. This will ensure accuracy in the BIM model. Document progress Documenting the entire process can give you valuable insights. It is crucial to set up an open communication channel between the onsite teams and the BIM team to ensure that the reality of the site is being updated in the model on an ongoing basis. These insights can then help you ensure high-quality as-built models that drive higher-quality efforts for facility management and renovation and refurbishment. To ensure the best quality and complete accuracy in your BIM models, you need to be fully aware of how the software works. That must be tied into the design and construction processes and information flow from the site. That will help deliver a high-quality and accurate BIM model that delivers the maximum impact.

BIM Standards and why are they important? It is 2023, and with hundreds of advancements in different sectors every month, one can stay abreast only of the best ones. Everyone is familiar with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and agrees it is a must-have for the AECO Industry. BIM, a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics, is typically used to design, construct, and operate buildings. BIM implementation for any project/organization requires well-defined processes and standards.?  What are BIM Standards? BIM standard refers to the guidelines, protocols, and best practices used to ensure that BIM models are created and used consistently and effectively. Various organizations have developed several BIM standards, some of which are not necessarily mandated by governments. However, those standards can still be widely adopted and used as a benchmark for quality and best practices in the construction industry. With standards in place, a more comprehensive digital infrastructure is envisioned, which in effect, is helping stakeholders position their construction projects more efficiently.?  What are some of the BIM Standards? The ISO 19650, a series of international standards, has helped organizations establish a unified approach across each of their regions and offices, creating immediate efficiencies and increasing the mobility of their internal resources.' National BIM Standard - This is a set of guidelines for using BIM in the United States. It is maintained by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). BuildingSMART International? A global not-for-profit community that focuses on solving industry problems by developing open and international digital data-sharing solutions. Singapore BIM guide - It is used as a reference guide for BIM standards for construction projects and includes a guide for BIM Execution Plan, which is an agreement between the Employer and project members. CIC BIM Protocol - Commissioned by Construction Industry Council, this legal agreement establishes the obligations and liabilities of using BIM.  Why are BIM Standards necessary? 1. BIM Standards can ease the integration of models for team members from various parts of the world. Despite being in different geographic locations, it is efficient to integrate information when all team members utilize the same BIM standards and data structures. This can facilitate team member collaboration and coordination and streamline the design and construction process.  2. BIM standards provide guidelines and best practices for creating and using BIM models. Still, they do not necessarily dictate how the models should be made or used in various situations. It leaves some room for individual interpretation and creativity within the limits of the standards. However, it is essential to follow the core principles and requirements of the standards to ensure that the models are consistent, interoperable, and of sufficient quality to support the design, construction, and operation of buildings. ?  3. To ensure that an organization uses BIM consistently and effectively, it may seek BIM certification. Certification can be awarded to teams for compliance with BIM standards and as part of the competency evaluation. This helps demonstrate the team's proficiency in using BIM and helps to build confidence in the team's abilities among clients and stakeholders. Certification can also improve the overall quality of the project, as it ensures that the team follows best practices in using BIM.  4. Integration with various tools can be easier with BIM standards as the standards help to ensure that BIM models are created and used consistently. This will eventually reduce the time and trial and error required for solving real-time problems at work, helping companies and stakeholders improve BIM management and de-risk their projects.?  5. BIM standards differ by country and region, and construction companies must know the specific standards that apply to their projects. In some cases, a construction company may be required to comply with local and global standards, depending on the project's specific requirements. For example, a construction company may be working on a project in a country that has adopted its BIM standards. Still, the project may also have global funding or stakeholders, which could require the company to comply with additional international BIM standards. In such cases, the company needs to ensure that they are complying with all applicable standards. Interested in reading more? Stay tuned for more blogs!  Five Things About BIM You Must Know!

Request for Proposal (RFP) was floated, and 5 bids were received. An interesting enhancement in the evaluation criteria was the emphasis on prior work experience, over being just restricted to commercials. The principal contractor  Samsung Korea  was appointed to evaluate this process also. They visited the Excelize office, reviewed the companys processes, quality audit protocols, team capabilities and even the license compliance for the BIM tools to be used in the project. This is a convention and exhibition centre spread over an area of more than 8 million square feet comprising of high-end retail, Theatre, convention and exhibition centre, service apartments, residential, commercial offices, etc. Observations: This project coordination would have been a massive challenge if BIM was not deployed. Roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders were clearly defined when related to BIM implementation The modeling approach was a hybrid one: Design models were provided by foreign design consultants During the construction phase, the BIM team was asked to build the architectural, structural and services models. MEPF (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing Fixtures) consultants were to build their own models. On-site team was responsible for coordination with contractors team and the principal contractor was responsible for the construction planning and simulation of design. This was the first project that had a requirement for an as-built model along with asset tagging This was unique and one of the biggest projects with mixed use design, multiple designers and consultants were involved in the project. To get timely resolution from the consultant was the biggest challenge for coordination. Owners team should appoint a BIM champion to drive BIM modelling and allied services. It cannot be done through the contractor as they do not have the complete view of the project. Asset strategy should be thought and formulated early in the lifecycle as this affects the LOD of the model 4D construction simulation was done but was not used for catch-up planning. Models built were not used at coordination meetings but only the clash report was reviewed. Phase 2: Campus for a large IT services company - 2015 An IT giant required BIM support for setting up multiple campuses. It was mandatory for the project team to setup standards; no BIM execution plan was set up for these projects though. The Request for Proposal (RFP) had a very clear scope of work identified and the deliverables were documented. A contract was drafted clearly stating these aspects. Observations: The scope extended itself beyond BIM modeling for clash detection and coordination, as laid out in the contract. Besides modeling for clash detection and coordination, it included: Extracting Bill of Quantities (BOQ) from clash free design model and bill verification for the BOQ from model and contractors Running Account (RA) bills 4D BIM dashboards and reporting to management Appointment of on-site BIM coordinator Most of the issues stemmed from the top-down approach. No time was given to site teams to adopt and evolve through processes. Contracts made with the contractor had not specified BIM verification which created tremendous resistance at the contractors end. Owners kept tweaking the design even while the construction was being done, so many changes had to be incorporated in real-time. BIM models were not used to generate the 2D. It was a 2D to 3D effort, which was the reverse of the usual approach which made it more cumbersome. Site changes on materials resulted in consumed quantity not matching tender quantity or BIM quantity as estimated in the plan On-site coordinator took around 6-7 months to feel included as a part of the team. The adoption on the first project was a failure and as BIM consultants, Excelize team faced push back from everyone. By the time, the team started work on the third location, the acceptance had increased manifold.  BIM mandates BIM will gain momentum only when its implementation will be mandated by the government or at an enterprise level. The adoption of BIM has been mandated in many countries globally, though there is no such mandate in India. The advancement of BIM implementation solely relies on the success or benefit achieved on every project at an organizational level. For many years in the past decade a BIM Consultant would implement BIM on any project only for coordination during design phase with an objective to get accurate quantities for estimation & bill verification during the construction of the project. Since 2020 while the world has been battling with COVID19, adoption of BIM has increased threefold especially the architecture and design firms. BIM has also been regulated due to mandated in the private sector in India. The Public sector has been prompt in regulating BIM Implementation depending on the size of the projects and the ease of managing. Even with the successful implementation of 5D BIM on the Maha metro project in Nagpur BIM has not become a mandate on all the metro projects in the country. Likewise, infrastructure projects are looking beyond regulation of BIM implementation and are now looking to adopting digital integration platform in construction phase of projects for the ease of asset management during lifetime of the project. This includes incorporating BIM models, project plans for 4D simulation and monitoring and integration with ERP tools for 5D cost management. All this is possible with mandates at various levels.

Construction is one of the deadliest industries for its workers in the USA. With more innovative and ambitious projects kicking off at different cities and towns as the fears of the pandemic taper off, more and more construction professionals are deployed to work at sites. The rush to complete projects fast, make up for a lost time, and deliver projects may be posing danger to their lives. Theres little doubt that the first focus should be to make the construction sector a safer place to work. As it happens, one of the most powerful options to minimize safety risks in the construction sector could be turning to Building Information Modeling or BIM tools. What we know of BIM is that it comprises a range or suite of software applications that help streamline a construction project by visualizing a construction project in 3D (or more dimensions) and enables easy management of construction activities as per a project plan. It allows managers or contractors to break down construction activities into modules, assign staff, visualize renderings of plans, share data on construction activities, timelines, and various other parameters with all stakeholders. It empowers project managers to effortlessly manage the lifecycle of a construction project and enable it to comply with client requirements as well as with local and regional compliance policies by regulators. We also know that more construction companies are now relying on BIM to manage their work and predict outcomes in daily operations. In fact, the global BIM software market size is expected to grow to USD 8.8 Billion by 2025. This is a testimony to the success that construction companies are enjoying. While all those benefits are well-known, one of the most far-reaching impacts of BIM could be to ensure that the project site becomes safer for work. By modeling all the requirements, it is easier to predict exactly the conditions workers will be exposed to during the construction. This allows BIM to become a vital component in ensuring safety at the worksite. Let us examine the top 4 ways in which BIM can prove to be the enabler of a safer construction job site: Identify potential hazards BIM can help in identifying potentially hazardous environments within a construction project that may pose risk to a worker. By modeling the construction process in 3D or with advanced options, it is possible to identify areas where collisions between moving construction items are more likely to occur, spots where risky maneuvers are required for completion of work, etc. Once such hazardous work locations are traced and noted in advance, it is possible to prepare a work plan to model construction activities that take into consideration extra care in these hazardous areas, including worker training and best practices. Reduced on-site activities With BIM, it becomes easier to plan construction by incorporating a lot of prefabricated structures and elements. These prefabricated elements can be built separately at other locations and transported to the final construction site thereby reducing workloads within the actual project site. When work is less, there are fewer chances for collisions and other hazardous activities that may be endured by workers when different works such as pre-fabrication, etc. are done at the project site itself. Other components like plumbing, ventilation and cooling systems too can be built on pre-manufactured shared racks and then finally integrated into the construction site easily reducing the need for manual intervention for hoisting and installing them on tall buildings individually all the time. By leveraging BIM for planning and scheduling, it also becomes possible to reduce the number of people onsite by adopting innovative models like offshore+onsite for greater efficiency and safety. Autonomous safety checklist With BIM, it is possible to model all sorts of risks within the construction environment. Once all risks are identified, then it becomes easier for creating a safety checklist for workers to follow in their daily tasks. Every day these checklists can be autonomously verified to ensure that only the right personnel with the right credentials and protection standards are allowed to work on each designated area of the project. This can also set the stage for better compliance with government regulations on workplace safety. Of course, one of the key benefits of using BIM for planning is clash detection at the planning stage. This allows more efficient work schedules to be created and effort wastage reduced. Of course, it also reduces the need for on the fly changes to be made onsite as workarounds to such clashes. This also helps prevent accidents and unsafe compromises. Knowledgeable workers When work hazards are identified and checklists for staying safe are prepared with the aid of BIM, then it becomes easier to train staff on following safety norms. Workers are provided with better insights to carry out their individual tasks while adhering to safety norms. Real-life simulations of events like collisions failed safety norms, and other faulty work routines can be demonstrated using modern technologies like Virtual Reality that feed off the BIM models to show the staff how to be cautious and controlled. 15% of the total cost of the private sector for fatal and non-fatal injuries is being incurred by the construction sector. The construction sector is an industry where the safety of workers is often a matter of controversy with lawsuits and legal ramifications aplenty. Hence, to build a long-lasting and sustainable business model, construction companies must make employee safety a key focus of their strategic plans as well. With BIM, it becomes easier to pre-plan all construction activities and thereby ensure that workers are protected always.

Fluctuating demand, climate change, and the fluctuations in the oil market are some of the main drivers for this ongoing transformation. And today, the pandemic has completely changed how projects are built (and delivered). Companies have had to restructure their plans to reflect the changing social and economic needs of the region. The only way construction companies can keep up with these evolving changes is through digital transformation. The current state of affairs The Middle East construction sector (and in fact every other sector in every other region) is under immense pressure to minimize carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Embracing a greener approach to building and infrastructure design, construction and delivery is compelling construction giants to build new strategies that could help in the decarbonization of projects. These strategies center on finding more efficient ways of working that minimize wasted effort and materials. Simultaneously, projects in the Middle East market have been experiencing a slump in value due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Priorities have been constantly changing for companies and governments. The value of construction contract awards reached only about $24 billion in the first ten months of 2020, compared to over $50 billion for the full year in 2019. Perhaps unexpectedly, the pandemic has also caused clients to seek greater social and economic value from their project investments at a time when investors and developers are postponing (or trimming) their investment plans in response to fluctuating demand. It is also visible that government bodies are seeking to control capital spending on all but the most critical infrastructure projects. The scope for digital transformation Despite the overwhelming impact of COVID-19, the potential for new projects in the Middle East remains constant. At the beginning of November 2020, projects worth an estimated $4.3 trillion were planned or were under construction across the MENA region. And the best way for construction companies to capitalize on these opportunities while addressing the new challenges of today is through the digital transformation of projects in the region. Here are some technology approaches that can help them achieve just that. Adopting advanced Building Information Modelling (BIM) models and associated processes can allow companies to more efficiently plan, design, construct, and manage their projects and infrastructure. These powerful tools, supported by competent technology partners, can help companies take a comprehensive view of all the elements of a construction project and drive higher levels of interoperability, flexibility, and customization while ensuring the best returns on investments. Cloud-based digital twins offer several benefits to designers, contractors, suppliers, and operators. Through the intelligent digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility, digital twins can help in better and richer engagement between various stakeholders in a virtual world. This makes planning and coordination more effective, reducing on-site clashes and late-stage variations that lead to delays and disputes. As the data available for construction sites explodes, AI looks set to have a far-reaching impact. AI will help in cutting down the probability (and impact) of crucial issues while improving the safety of the workforce. AI will not only help in ensuring onsite safety it will also help in mitigating risks. Through real-time monitoring and the use of proximity alarms, AI can help alert workers when they are in danger while allowing them to practice safe social distancing techniques. When used alongside sensor technology, AI can also enable real-time monitoring of construction assets, allowing for more efficient utilization, more effective maintenance as well as better optimization of service delivery. Given how costly mistakes can prove to be, especially when the sector is already experiencing a financial crunch, modern CAD techniques will enable designers and architects to produce models more precisely  thus avoiding costly mistakes. These techniques will allow them to carry out accurate measurements, spot design flaws, and conduct advanced analysis on designs while offering the flexibility to make changes on the fly. Many construction companies looking to adapt and evolve their businesses as a result of the pandemic are also keen on adopting new approaches and evolving practices and processes. To make on-site inspections easier (and more efficient), the Middle East construction sector will also see a rise in the adoption of remote visual tools such as drones and laser scanning. These tools will help companies to remotely monitor the progress, quality, and security of their projects. The road ahead As the Middle East construction sector looks to emerge stronger from the impact of the pandemic while continuing to develop some of the best construction marvels in the world, companies must undergo digital transformation to ease cost pressures, enhance productivity (and efficiency) as well as boost profits. Given that digital transformation can open the doors to greater control and visibility, the willingness to embrace modern digital tools to transform the delivery of complex engineering projects in the region is high. In the coming months, companies will embrace modern technology to improve the precision with which they plan their projects, efficiently deal with issues, enable richer engagement, avoid project delays (and costly mistakes), and ensure continued safety and sustainability.

BIM technologies are becoming an unavoidable element in all areas of a construction process like bidding, pre-construction, construction and post-construction. Nowadays, owners demandBIM servicesfrom everybody engaged in the construction industry including architects, general contractors, and engineering firms. However, general contractors and construction managers are struggling to get maximum output from BIM. Here the uses and advantages ofBIM building modeling for general contractorsand construction managers are narrated. The traditional project delivery approach, the traditional use of2D Computer Aided Drafting (CAD)technology, and the size of construction firms cause the fragmented nature of the construction industry, which will lead to a lack of labor productivity.Design-Build, which is the traditional construction project delivery approach, fragments the responsibilities of participants during the design and construction stages. That means this approach restricts the opportunities of the general contractor or the construction manager for a collaborative involvement during the design phase of the project. Moreover, the common and traditional two-dimensional CAD drawings cannot encourage a truly collaborative approach. The Building Information Modeling process includes virtual design and construction of the project. The traditional approach does not facilitate the involvement of the general contractor or construction manager in the construction process until the completion of the design phase. That is why it cannot promote the advantages of BIM. Therefore the better project deliveries to collaborate and to improve the use of BIM are construction management at Risk, Design/Build and Integrated Project deliveries (IPD). So, the general contractors can collaborate through BIM during the design phase and provide maximum input. It also maximizes the ability to influence the cost and schedule. USE OF BIM TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS: VISUALIZATION As a result of visualization general contractors get an idea about the final product. They can easily understand how the project will look like at the end. 3D COORDINATION As BIM helps collaboration of the construction team with the engineer, architect and the owner at early stages of the design phase, the efforts of general contractors and specialty contractors can be coordinated in advance of construction. It will result in reduced design errors and a better understanding ahead of time of the work to be done. PREFABRICATION Reduced field labor cost and time, as well as increased accuracy in good quality construction, are the main advantages of prefabrication. Building Information Models include the specifications, finishes, sequences, and the 3D visual for each component to provide this level of accuracy. So, the contractors can generate details for the product in their fabrication software using BIM. CONSTRUCTION PLANNING The scheduling and sequencing of the model involved in the construction planning coordinate virtual construction in time and space. The schedule of the anticipated construction progress can be integrated to a virtual construction. This is the responsibility of general contractors to plan for coordination, shop drawings, approval, fabrication, transportation, and installation. They have to ensure the lead time for the material is accounted. So, they can get enough time to install or assemble. General contractors are able to update this information on their models. They can achieve accurate building practices with the use of BIM technologies. COST ESTIMATION Quantity take-off and pricing are the two main elements of cost estimation. An expert cost estimator is required to analyze the components of a material and how they get installed. We can extract the quantities from a Building Information Model to a cost database or an excel file. The quantity extraction from BIM model helps the general contractors to increase the productivity of estimators, especially in the collaborative work approach of the construction and design team. RECORD MODEL At the end of a project, the construction managers can provide the owner with a record Building Information Model, which contains the integration of the as-builts from the subcontractors. To conclude,BIM initiates 3D coordinationbetween subcontractors and vendors during the early design phase. As BIM is able to influence the cost, it can increase its impact on a project. BIM enables the team to come up with ideas and provide solutions to the problems before they become high-cost impacts on the project. BENEFITS OF BIM TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS: General Contractors can provide construct-ability, sequencing, value, and engineering reports Collaborative visualization of expectancy and needs of the project Decreased MEP coordination time Decreased RFIs Avoidance of extra expenditure Saving time and labor at the site Avoidance of schedule delays during construction The positive final impression of the owner Ability to help an owner with maintenance and renovation Even though six uses of BIM for general contractors are highlighted here, the most useful feature ofBIM for general contractorsis BIM 4D scheduling. UsingBIM-based 4D scheduling, the general contractors can understand the construction components and schedule progress clearly, which will enable better construction planning and avoid cost overruns. There are different BIM tools in the BIM process that are offered to enable this approach. So the general contractors should have an idea about the tools to accomplish their demands in a particular project.

Whats interesting is the rising trend of renovation projects! The nation is expecting up to USD 510 billion in the home improvement sector alone. Renovation projects face challenges different from those seen in new construction projects; challenges that have a huge impact on the renovation completion. These may include the uncertain existing building conditions and the limited work area or space constraints due to these existing conditions. For a successful renovation, these aspects need to be identified in the initial design phase. Renovation projects also require the assessment of time and schedule constraints. Building information is valuable for renovation activities. However, many renovation projects are hindered by the lack of adequate project management, project delays, and heavy financial losses due to insufficient or outdated building information. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can come to the rescue in such scenarios. Using BIM in new construction projects is now widely accepted. However, application of BIM in renovation projects is yet at a nascent stage of adoption. The accurate information management of the entire asset can be used to refurbish existing buildings. Let us look at the advantages of BIM in renovation projects: Enhanced visualization and data management BIM is a 3D representation of the asset and all its components that are difficult and time consuming to capture in the CAD format. This repository includes information on structural elements like the location of foundations, beams, rooves, and columns that are needed for visualization of the existing structure and space constraints. With this data, potential design challenges can be identified in the initial design phase of the renovation project. Besides, the model that is updated throughout the renovation life cycle can also help plan project execution and performance accurately. However, acquiring existing building information can be difficult in the case of older buildings as documentation is not always available. In such cases, As-Built Cloud Point model can be generated using laser scanning technologies. Increased energy efficiency BIM implementation in renovation projects can aid in increasing the energy efficiency of the asset. For example, natural lighting and shading aspects can be simulated with the help of a BIM model. What-if analysis will help design and simulate the energy consumption for the renovated structure more accurately. This can also be done for the existing structure to make it more energy efficient. BIM models can also be useful in calculating the carbon footprint getting a carbon credit report on the asset. Resource, cost, and time optimization Accurate building material quantification and other asset data through the BIM model can help project managers optimise construction materials and resources. Besides, project stakeholders can perform budget estimation and cost planning based on the potential risks very early in the design phase. Integrating the project schedule with BIM model also ensures there are no project delays and timeline extensions. BIM models have real-time information, and this information exchange reduces chances of conflict and miscommunication between project stakeholders. Thus, BIM adoption can help achieve resource, cost, and time optimization in renovation projects with relative ease. To conclude, renovation projects come with risks and uncertainties of the aging building. BIM can bridge the gap between the challenges of renovation and the possibilities of high-quality construction. A clear visualization of the outcome, optimum data and resource management, time and cost efficiency, and enhanced energy management are a few things that BIM can support on renovation projects. As industry professionals, we actively encourage BIM adoption in the AEC industry for both new construction and renovation projects.

One such area is Facility Management, and BIM benefits and strategies trickle down in this function in many layers. Facility management refers to the management of existing real estate based on the collection, storage, generation, update, and sharing of documents relating to the history of the building (charts, technical datasheets, user manuals, documents, reports, projects, etc.). In the BIM field, facility management is associated with 7D, the dimension that deals with managing buildings throughout their life cycle. Let's understand the role of BIM in Facility Management in depth. What is the function of BIM in Facility Management? BIM allows facilities managers to manage the building throughout its lifecycle by providing access to data such as building layouts, electrical and mechanical systems, and equipment specifications in real-time, enabling them to make informed decisions, streamline maintenance and repair processes and improve building performance. It contributes to the enhanced operation, management, financial performance, and maintenance of the building and infrastructure projects. What role do the BIM models play in Facility Management? BIM models play a crucial role in facilities management. They provide a clear understanding of the physical characteristics of a building, such as its size, shape, and spatial relationships, which are essential for facilities management activities such as maintenance, repair, and renovation. These models can streamline the building management throughout its lifecycle and provide facilities managers with real-time information about the building and its systems. How does BIM facilitate the Facility Management Process? BIM facilitates the facility management process in several ways. Here are a few of them:  Asset Management: BIM provides facility managers with a comprehensive view of the building's components and systems, making it easier to plan installations, track, maintain, and replace assets. In addition, it allows a better knowledge of asset locations to resolve issues.  Space Management: BIM enables facility managers to visualize and manage the occupancy of a building with greater accuracy. There are different industry standards to measure a space, and in BIM, the space is automatically adapted and created as per the area type chosen by the space planner. This simplifies the process for facility managers to test layouts before physically renovating the space.  Energy and Cost Management: BIM provides facility managers with real-time data about the building's energy consumption, suggesting alternatives to adopt efficient and environment-friendly methods. It offers solutions to manage budgets and reduce the risk of cost overruns.  Maintenance Management: BIM enables facility managers to reach their goal of extending the lifespan of an asset at a minimal cost. Therefore, it allows the maintenance of assets in a single facility, multiple facilities, or merely of a group of equipment or machinery.  What are the benefits of BIM in Facility Management? BIM can be highly beneficial in Facility Management and building operations post-construction. A few of the numerous benefits of BIM to facilities management are:  Improved Decision-Making and Increased Efficiency: BIM gives facilities managers real-time access to detailed information about a building and its systems, which can inform decision-making and optimize building performance. With facilities management tools, such as Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS), potential errors can be identified and rectified, thus increasing overall efficiency.  Streamlined Maintenance and Repairs: BIM can be used to plan and execute maintenance and repair activities, reducing downtime and improving building performance. The comprehensive information provided by BIM can also be used to prioritize maintenance activities, schedule repairs, and ease the future implementation of new equipment and system. O&M Best Practice Guide mentioned that ""On average, companies save between 10-12% in costs by investing in preventive maintenance.""  Enhanced Energy Management and Reduced Energy Waste: BIM models can track energy consumption and identify continuous improvement and energy savings opportunities. By using BIM to optimize building performance, facilities managers can reduce energy waste and decrease the carbon footprint of the building. Technological advances and increasing demand for enhanced building performance and sustainability will likely shape the future of BIM in facility management. A few potential developments in the future of BIM in facility management include increased integration with IoT, advanced analytics, and interaction with Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.

It provides a glimpse into the future to the clients throughBIM Modeling services. Visualization helps review the concept and design objectives. It can act as a communication tool for the contractor and the consultant. Visualization is relevant in a project lifecycle, from the very beginning to the very end. Visualization has a crucial role in BIM, as it is an effective communication tool for various BIM stakeholder groups. ADVANTAGES OF VISUALIZATION THROUGH BIM MODELING: At first, the client gets an idea of what he will get for his money. Besides, the client can make a good selection during the project and ensure that the critical path of the project is understood. As a result, the firm can deliver the project on time, within budget and with minimal issues. Therefore, the construction firms try to implement visualization tactics in all phases of a project and to involve all parties in using it. The benefits of BIM are varied for each one in the construction industry. While it is an advanced computer-aided design for someone, the others find it as a series of models for distinct elements of a project. Using BIM, designers explore alternative concepts, optimize their designs and conduct value engineering. BIM MODELING LEADS TO IMPROVED COORDINATION: BIM Modeling services enable designers and engineers to work together and so they can identify and solve issues with the help of the model before the construction starts. As traditionally design drawings should be coordinated to ensure that various building systems do not clash, though most of the clashes and issues could have been identified only during the construction phase. Due to late identification of clashes, the decision at the construction site is delayed and ultimately costs in delayed schedule and waste of materials. But if the potential problems can be identified in the design phase during BIM Modeling and resolved prior to construction with the help of BIM technology, huge wastage of resources could be avoided. HOW DO OWNERS BENEFIT FROM VISUALIZATION? Using BIM Modeling for project visualization, the contractors can understand how the building will come together. But it is not only beneficial for the construction team. The project visualization is an effective marketing tool. It can show the client or the owner how the building will look like when construction progresses. The owners of the large projects generally demand physical mock-up models because it helps them visualize, understand and make decisions on the functionality and aesthetics part of the project more efficiently. BIM Modeling enables to make virtual mock-ups and to test for fabrication of the cost. BIM addresses problems beyond the limits of traditional 2D drawings: BIM enables changes during the early phases of a project and planning of the construction schedule before work starts on-site. As we can understand which material should be required and installed first, we can save time. Moreover, the clashes are identified early in the design stage and so on-site clashes are reduced significantly. Contractors use BIM model to prepare shops and fabrication drawings as well asto coordinate drawings. The use ofBIM Modeling for ownersis optimizing building maintenance, renovations, and energy efficiency. They also use it to analyze life-cycle cost. In short, BIM ensures the teamwork of a firm by enabling collaboration among designers, constructions, and owners.

In fact, not only private companies endorse the use of BIM but a few governments have started mandating its use, as well. Most definitely with its usefulness in the construction industry, BIM is here to stay. However as its use expands and grows within the sector, BIM is continually evolving, making it intimidating to adopt for some construction professionals and companies. Additionally, there are so many unfounded myths out there that a lot of construction businesses have been missing out on the benefits of BIM. Today, we will discuss the five common myths about BIM and elaborate why they simply are not true. So listen up! 1. BIM is just a marketing hype for 3D modeling There is a lot of misconception that BIM is just a marketing hype for 3D modeling. Although 3D modeling is an integral part of BIM, it is not its only component. BIM is an over-encompassing 3D-based process that allows collaborative work between engineers, architects, contractors, and building owners. For many construction organisations, BIM is already a standardised process of how they do work and business. With BIM technology and tools, designers and construction teams can communicate about design and construction and can coordinate data and information across different levels. The implementation of BIM as a lifecycle process allows the use of models to extract actual locations and measurements. This new workflow allows the field team to have more efficient processes with accurate models and less rework. BIM is integral to everything we do on our projects. Its a lot less expensive dealing with issues such as clashes in the virtual world than in the real world, Sandra Wilkin of Bradford Construction said in a 2014 BIM panel discussion. 2. BIM is for big firms and big projects This is another false sentiment. BIM is not only for complicated and time-consuming projects. Regardless of size, construction projects essentially deal with the same problems. There is value in working with BIM even on small projects, whether privately initiated or government facilitated. No matter the size, BIM is useful in calculating design costs, and in saving time on estimating and budgeting. BIM allows project members to make changes and update documents and plans automatically. 3. BIM is expensive and time-consuming There is actually little data published on the actual cost of BIM in a construction project. So far, there is no public data available comparing relevant costs of BIM implementation versus their monetised benefits. There is also no evidence supporting the concept that BIM takes more time. Obviously, BIM will require some monetary and time investment when you first adopt it and the scale of investment will vary on factors. Studies, however, show that there is a 20-25% potential efficiency savings from working in a BIM environment. BIMs efficiency gains rely on finding accurate data faster in one single data source and hence, being able to make accurate data-driven decisions. Realising those efficiencies reduces the overall risks and results in saving you lots of money. 4. BIM implementation requires a new staff team This simply is not true. You can actually train an existing team or round up your existing staff into a team to implement BIM. BIM implementation doesnt have to be so difficult. With BIM advancements, even your onboarding can be streamlined workflows that share needed information between your office and the field. Newer technology makes it easier to integrate your BIM model in the field and collect real-world data in real-time. As a matter of fact, the most successful companies in implementing BIM are those who trained their existing project managers, engineers, and teams to integrate BIM into their existing processes. 5. BIM transition results in productivity losses that cannot be regained It is a common assumption that implementing a BIM solution results in irrecoverable productivity losses during the transition period. Old data suggest an average 25-50% productivity loss during the initial transition and training. However, these initial productivity losses are easily dismissed by productivity and efficiency gains. For Lott + Barber Architects, their productivity gains outweighed their initial productivity loss. Similar Revit users in 2004 experienced productivity gains of more than 50% and close to 20% experienced productivity gains greater than 100% in the long run. Clearly, you not only regain your productivity losses but you also add productivity gains once your BIM solution is in place. Final word BIM is a very useful process and tool that will benefit designers, engineers, architects, contractors, and building owners. It allows a complete view of your entire project information while it communicates accurate data to all your relevant stakeholders. Hopefully, this brief article has cleared up the common BIM myths that cause unnecessary and false anxiety in the construction industry. May we help shed light on those moving to or are in the middle of their transition to BIM. We urge you to get started with your BIM transition today; its not as complicated as everyone leads you to think!

Being one of the largest and significant industries, the Construction industry has a main role in determining the gross domestic product (GDP) of many several advanced countries. This unique industry exists in a dynamic environment and therefore itself it faces lots of changes, conflicts, and complexity of communications, which will result in the delay and sometimes the failure of the project. Here comes the significance of BIM, as it can assist in creating a traditional delay analysis method. As this method is easy to perform and deliver its message, the problems between all involved parties can be solved earlier. Understanding thebenefits of BIM, several construction firms are now starting to invest in BIM technologies during all stages like preconstruction, bidding, construction, and post-construction. Therefore, owners needBIM servicefrom everybody involved in a project including construction managers, architects, and engineering firms. The article aims at understanding current applications of BIM in different disciplines and to comprehendhow Design to Build and Build to Design concepts can be implemented along with focusing on 3D and 4D construction simulation. High level of communication and collaboration environment is the most advantageous of BIM. It can cover all aspects of a construction project by incorporating every parameter like time (4D) and cost (5D). AEC uses BIM services in several application areas such as photorealistic rendering, virtual design review, cost estimating, analyzing design alternatives, analyzing execution methodologies, and project document production. A categorized framework has been established for eD/4D model areas of applications into three key phases such as design, shaping, and construction. DELAY ANALYSIS USING 4D SIMULATIONS Professionals and Forensic delay analysts must become more aware of the capabilities of 4D implementation in the AEC industry, As-Built models should highlight to the industry. Case Study:Delay monitoring through 4D construction simulation Execution of multiple projects at the same time, and monitoring the progress of every project is intimidating. The project owners are very keen to use technology to assist them in monitoring progress remotely. Monitoring delays in execution is another plus of BIM implementation that is achieved. Simulating the construction activity for planned and actual dates and highlighting these to the client and project team ensures that execution delays are minimal. The clients are able to monitor the execution remotely on multiple projects The project plan (from Primavera) is linked with the BIM model. To the 3D model, the 4th dimension of time is added and the construction simulation for every activity is generated. This linking is done initially for a baseline project plan and routinely updated (every 2 weeks) for actual updates to the project plan. Using this, delays are highlighted, and the construction sequence is corrected, thus achieving the goals of efficient resources and material management. 4D BIM AND SCHEDULING (TIME): Construction planning and management:BIM models include tools for a visual depiction of the space utilization of the job site through the entire project construction, which provide a means of verifying site logistics and yard operations. Several temporary components like Lorries, cranes, and fencing can be included in the model. It can also incorporate the traffic access routes for cranes, Lorries, lifts, and other large items. Using the tools, we can also enhance the planning and monitoring of health and safety precautions required on-site, when the project progresses. Schedule visualization:Schedule visualization provides multiple sources of accurate real-time information and using this, the project members can make sound decisions. A chart can be used in the BIM model to show the critical path. The chart also gives a visual representation of the dependency of some sequences on others. Advanced BIM models can identify the changes in a design, which will influence the critical path, and indicate the possible corresponding impact of these changes on the overall delivery of the project. A large project may have more than 100 activities at the proposal and schematic stages. While the scheduled activities are between 500 and 1000 during design development, they will range from 1000 to 10000 or more during the construction document stage. So, it is important to make sure that no information is missing when the project progresses to the construction document.

BIM has delivered a significant impact on long-term projects in terms of economic as well as technical viability. Owing to the cost benefits and various other advantages from the power of BIM, many countries have mandated the use of BIM technology for public projects. This move, in itself, speaks volumes about the significant potential of BIM technology in a construction project. BIM applies across the design as well as the construction phase of a project. Of course, the life-cycle of a construction project doesnt end at the handing-over of a facility; it is a continuing cycle. Many traditional construction projects accepted the project life-cycle to end at the handing over process, but, in this era, facilities management is a part of the construction project, and BIM plays a vital role in helping the facilities managers in operating and maintaining a building. So, the long-term application of BIM technology ensures the efficient design, effective implementation, and smooth functioning and maintenance of a building. The objectives of cost, quality, sustainability, and safety can be met efficiently with BIM technology. The collation and availability of large amounts of data at a centralized location have made operations easier for all the stakeholders of a construction project. Lets focus on one key community of stakeholders, the Project Manager. BIM & Project Managers To a large extent, the success of a project depends upon the capability of the project manager. Its important that the roles & responsibilities of a project manager should be clearly defined. BIM aids the project manager in fulfilling the onerous responsibilities of the role and duties by providing a centralized system that allows all the expertise & knowledge of all the involved parties to be brought together. BIM offers the seamless integration of information and ideas that help in mitigating clashes faced during the construction phase. Lets look into how & why project managers can use BIM: Effective Communication & Coordination in the Team A successful construction project is a result of hard work and input of various involved teams. Traditionally, every team from architects, engineers, builders, electricians, and operations works independently. BIM brings all of them together and creates a centralized pool of information that is accessible to anyone from anywhere at any time. This feature has facilitated effective communication between all the departments, resulting in perfect coordination in the team.The main task of a project manager is to ensure seamless coordination amongst the different groups, and BIM makes this tedious task more manageable. Accurate Timelines & Estimations Achieving timeline and cost objectives play a crucial role in defining the success of any construction project. BIM allows project managers to draw significantly more accurate timelines and cost estimations. The accuracy of the calculations during the planning phase helps in ramping up the effectiveness of the planning function and improves the financial planning of the project. Phasing-out On-Site Redesigning Every constructed building ends up being different from its original blueprint. The design tends to evolve as the construction process begins. Over time, these deviations tend to cause time lag and budgeting issues because of the impact on work that follows such changes. Such work ends up having to be changed on the fly, in response to the ground reality. This takes time, costs money, and consumes resources. BIM allows the Project Manager to document the ongoing work better and prevent such situations. In addition, the clash-detection feature in BIM allows the project manager to identify any issues in the design that could cause clashes between different teams before the construction begins. This helps in saving not only time on redesigning but also the amount of raw material required and ensuring timely delivery of the project. Accurate Estimation of Raw Materials One of the most demanding tasks faced by a project manager is deriving estimations for the raw materials required. An inaccurate estimation, both over and under estimation, of raw materials, will result in time lag and over-expenditure. This directly affects the budget and timeline of the project. BIM helps in delivering accurate estimations and reducing the burden on the project manager of manual calculations. Handing-over and Facilities Management The role of a project manager in todays times is not limited to the construction phase. An effective construction project is one that supports efficient operations of the facility even after the handover. The project manager has to ensure that the facilities manager has all the required information for operating and maintaining the building during its operating life-cycle. The centralization of data in BIM helps make it easier for the project manager to handover information to the FM. The BIM models, by virtue of being updated, tend to reflect the as-built state of the structure better. This ensures that the FM provides updated and accurate information to the facilities manager. As is apparent, the application of BIM plays a vital role in the management of the project. A project manager can leverage the capability of BIM to deliver a successful construction project. BIM reduces the burden on the project manager of manually calculating and managing tasks. It seems clear that for a construction project to be successful today, project managers would do well to adopt BIM technology.

I can almost imagine the first developer putting a few skins, branches, and some leaves as a roof over a crude lean-to and asking the folks wanting to get in out of the cold for some fruits and perhaps an arrowhead or two for the privilege of owning their own home! The evolution of homo-sapiens brought in the industrial age. That progress led to the establishment of many industries  agriculture and construction were, almost certainly, the first ones to be discovered to cover the basic needs of food and shelter for survival.So, the industry has probably been around well before the term industry was coined. We have come a long way from building huts to constructing massive structures like the Burj Khalifa. And this was made possible only with technological advancements. Since completing my architecture over 25 years ago, I have been fascinated to witness the evolution of the industry. So, here are the top 5 changes that, I believe, have transformed the construction industry in the time that I have been a witness and active participant: 1.Plan & Design Imagine keeping manual records of every detail of the plan from its inception to the handing-over phase. And then going through reams of paper when the time comes to fix a leak or, heaven forbid, if a fire breaks out. The thought is frightening in todays digital world, but we used to do this all the time. Studios used to be a messy affair with sheets and huge rolls of papers containing designs and plans. Duplication and inaccuracy of data both created havoc for the construction crew as well as the facilities manager. The maintenance work got hit due to the difficulty of accessing the right information at the right time. Owing to this, digitization in the construction industry was very well received.CADfirst hit the market only to be overtaken byBIM. The former aided architects and engineers whereas the latter offer an integrated platform not only for ACE but the entire fraternity on the construction site. The centralized source of information made it easily accessible to any stakeholder. Even as BIM adoption grows, today many developed nations mandate the use of BIM for large projects and many construction companies have their own BIM efforts underway. 2.Tools, Technology, and Equipment The construction industry is dependent upon its ecosystem. The success of any construction project requires efficiency from the downstream partners and contractors. The excavation of a site, moving and assembling larger pieces or materials, faster procurement, and delivery of the material; all contribute to the success of the project. Traditionally, there were too many gaps in communication and lags that resulted in the loss of productive hours. Much of this was due to a lack of streamlined orders and procurement, resulting in poorly timed deliveries. One of the leading causes of the lag in the procurement of material was the thumb rule estimation of quantities. With the help of technology, it has become easier to derive precise quantities of the material required and determine the right time to order them. Evolving technology has also provided us with better earthing machines, concrete mixers, cranes, and conveyors that are efficient enough to do the heavy lifting posed by the demands of modern-era construction. Using pre-fabricated structures or structural elements, that are fabricated offsite, has become viable because of the improvement in the transport of on-site handling equipment (more on that later). 3.Construction Materials The evolution of the construction industry didnt happen only in connection with how the work is done. With the help of technology, we discovered and created materials that supported the plain steel and concrete structures and provided them with more strength, grace, and durability. An array of innovative new materials is making an impact in specific areas of construction today. For e.g. honeycomb structures and forms are used for providing greater strength, polyester fiber offers durability for refitting sewers and water pipelines. Today, construction work is being undertaken at demanding locations like Arctic areas, undersea, and at radioactive sites to name a few of these extraordinary locations. The specialized materials aid the cause of out-of-the-box thinking in the construction industry. 4.Construction Methods Gone are the days when everything was made at the construction site itself. Off-site assembly and fabrication is an established trend now. Assembling of structural elements offsite has an edge over the on-site assembly. It saves time  the most significant asset in any construction project. Large-scale public infrastructure works are being benefitted the most with such off-site assembling of elements. Consider the Nagpur Metro project. The project zoomed ahead because of just such a synergy between offsite manufacture and on-site assembly. The pillars for the over-bridge are being constructed on-site, whereas the spans and bridges are made off-site. They are then transported to the location and placed on the pillars through machinery. This has accelerated the construction without causing problems for the public using roads. 5.Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence is gradually making its way into our daily lives. Many industries have implemented and benefitted from AI. And the construction world is taking notice. The use of computerized expert systems to aid construction work is gaining momentum. Some systems help in diagnosing the effect of wind and vibration problems in structures and in verifying welding performance qualifications. AI use-cases are still scarce on the ground. But as sensor and IoT technology become more common and the amount of data available to the construction company becomes strategically important, AI is bound to go mainstream very soon. Change is inevitable. Technology has crept into every aspect of construction. And it is letting us make what we previously thought to be impossible, possible. I wonder what the next 10 years will bring.  5 iconic construction projects in the UAE and what we can learn from them BIM for multi-family housing  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

Part of this change is being driven by an increasing reliance on Building Information Modelling (BIM)  a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. The BIM software provides a comprehensive view of all the elements of the construction before they are physically built. This helps the designers, architects, and builders to eliminate any shortcomings in the design ay the inception itself, thereby cutting costs and saving time. Time and cost are the two most vital elements in a construction project. A minor deviation or a clash detected late in the game can mean increased costs and time spent. The digital representation in the BIM software allows all the involved parties and stakeholders to understand the practical implication of the design. Why BIM? The benefits of using BIM are many:  Saves time  Effective cost-control tool  Collates and streamlines data making it easily accessible for everyone  Uses technology to eliminate human error  Helps in extracting an accurate estimate for the construction materials  A more comprehensive approach to a design  Saves construction time through clash detection  A view of the practical implication of a proposed design So, the benefits of BIM established, how do you go about selecting a BIM partner for your specific construction effort? How to choose a BIM partner? BIM services have gained importance in the recent past, and there are quite a few service providers in the market today. It can be hard to choose a BIM partner. To make the choice just that bit easier, here are some key points for you to consider: 1. Experience The most important thing to consider when selecting a BIM partner is the experience. What makes the BIM partner under consideration stand apart? It must be the experience. How many projects have they worked on? What specific role did they play? How large were the projects? How deep was their involvement? These questions will help give you an insight into just how skilled your potential partner is. 2. The Clientele Experience alone cannot be the parameter to finalize a BIM partner. A look at their clientele will help you in understanding the BIM partner's portfolio and their nature of work. Every construction project has its unique requirements and choosing a BIM partner with the right experience relevant to your own requirements could prove crucial. 3. References and Feedback Theres no better publicity than word-of-mouth publicity. If a BIM partner is as good as they claim to be, you will hear it from their clients in the market. Their reputation will be driven by the word-of-mouth publicity they are able to drive. That apart, do a reference check. Get in touch with the client references they provide. No one can give accurate insights into a service provider better than the clients they have been associated with. This feedback from the clients they have previously worked with or are currently working with will help you understand aspects like their professionalism, ability to meet deadlines, and other aspects important to you. 4. International Presence A BIM service provider with an international presence and experience will bring a greater depth and breadth of expertise that a purely locally-based BIM partner cannot. The international experience should mean that the BIM partner would have gained exposure to international best practices, cutting-edge tools and techniques, and ways of working. International projects are also likely to have driven this provider to create stronger processes for documentation, collaboration, and communication. This can add richness to your own project planning and execution as well. 5. People An experienced team with proper knowledge of BIM technology and its application is an essential asset. It is critical to find out about the team of your BIM partner and their overall experience with the various tools, techniques, and software. This is, of course, only part of the story. The people should have experience in the science of construction and in the details like building codes and rules too. 6. Latest Technology BIM software has also undergone a few evolutions over the years that it has been around. It is essential to know and verify whether the BIM partner under consideration is using the latest software and tools or not. Its not just about the BIM tools -what about their knowledge of the other technological advances in the field of construction? 7. Aligning Expectations Before making the final call, it is essential to define exactly what you are expecting from your BIM partner. Start with the end in mind and seek a path to that objective from your BIM partner. Define milestones and deliverables as tightly as is practically possible. This helps you and your BIM partner to stay on the same page. This will help you keep track of the success of this effort. Benjamin Franklin has said, Be slow in choosing a friend, slower in changing. Its easy to see that advice applying to your choice of BIM partner too. The right choice will help you derive cost benefits, save you time and effort, and help you excel in your project execution. When you get all that, theres really no reason to change then, is there?

With a23.9 %slump in the economy in the April to June quarter as compared to the same period in 2019, there has been widespread chaos and disruptions in almost every sector. The construction sector which employs nearly51 million people(the second largest employer in the country) and contributes approximately 9% of the nations GDP was hurt just as much or more. However, all is not gloomy for our domain as analysts expect a sharp return to growth in 2021. It is expected that from a slump of nearly14.9 %,the construction sector will register a formidable growth of 11.6% in 2021. Opportunities look set to emerge. As we learn to live with the virus and hopes of vaccines wax and wane, likely, business as usual will slowly settle in. Of course, there will still be challenges for construction companies to tackle. Here are the top 3: Employee Safety With COVID 19 still a threat, the most important challenge for construction companies is to keep their staff healthy and free from COVID infections on the sites. Obviously, employee safety is a moral imperative. That apart, a large number of people infected at any work site will cause turmoil, affect work deliverables, and cause delays. All this will ultimately push up costs. The net impact will be changed working conditions, more onerous compliance efforts, and altered processes that will take time to settle in. Lower Spending by Consumers There have been job losses and wage reduction across the economic spectrum. The uncertainty that looms large will certainly play on the minds of consumers and investors. In commercial real estate, there is also some concern about the impact of widespread work from home policies adopted by Indian corporates during the lockdowns. In several well-publicized examples, mostly from the technology or services sectors, companies have embraced long-term remote working policies. By allowing most (or all) of their employees to continue to work from home, they hope to save on real estate costs. Its still unclear how this will play out in the long term for the sector. Hence spending on construction will be more cautious and considered. Customer behaviour may have changed and they may now value new financing options, better proximity to healthcare centres, different features, and much more. The rise in Material Costs The pandemic has disrupted both national and international supply chains considerably and it will take a while before everything returns to pre-COVID levels. Until then, the construction sector must brace for frequent price hikes of raw materials due to a shortage of supply. Additionally, governments across states or the central government may bring in additional cess on taxes to strengthen their finances which will directly impact the price of materials. So how can the Indian construction industry make a revival in 2021 in the wake of these crucial challenges? The answer may lie with technology. By leveraging trusted technology, construction companies can uncover new opportunities for streamlining their operations and improving customer satisfaction leading to better sales. Lets see the top opportunities that technology can create for the Indian construction sector in 2021: Better Compliance to Employee Wellness and Safety By using the right set of technology solutions and platforms, construction companies can help in safeguarding the health of their employees. Workplace safety compliance can be enhanced using intelligent thermal scanning, digital fencing for ensuring social distance between staff, and several other possibilities. Along with arresting the spread of COVID, the opportunity can also be utilized to strategically bring in new protection and safety norms within the sector that will help in improving the lives of workers in the long run too. Improved Governance of Projects Through better project planning and modeling using BIM (Virtual Design and Construction-VDC), planners can estimate projects needs better, collaborate and communicate better, and easily manage the delivery for better results. Using BIM as the common framework, all the stakeholders can track the progress of projects, mitigate possible delays due to labor or material shortages, provide better estimates for pricing and revenue management and ultimately create a more efficiently managed and executed construction project. The opportunity in 2021 is to use such technology so that projects can be even managed by supervisors or engineers from remote locations through online monitoring. Personalized Sales Experience With advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology, it becomes easier for customers to experience the full scale of a project virtually. This will help construction companies create virtual tours for potential customers to better equip them with information about the project that may aid in their decision to invest. Technology can also help in creating targeted advertising campaigns to better market projects to the right audience with the right information on price, financing options, amenities, etc. to win their interest and ultimately lead to a deal. No question that we all want 2020 to end as fast as possible. 2021 is seen as a year of hope everywhere. The construction sector in India too is particularly optimistic about 2021. The belief is the new year will open the doors to solving numerous long-standing challenges in the industry with the help of technology. Many of the new norms adopted in the sector during the pandemic such as better health and safety systems for employees, improved project planning, could have a long-standing impact. Digital transformation could become the cornerstone in the Indian construction sector's revival plans for 2021 and it may all be down to the pandemic to have forced that change into the sector.

That has enabled them to ramp up their construction, use resources intelligently, and ensure safety and sustainability.The benefits of BIM adoptionare well-known. Even across the USA, companies have made projects more cost-effective, timely, and sustainable by adopting BIM. Construction companies and contractors have found that using BIM has also helped them prepare better project bids that help them win more orders. However, many companies are facing a tough timeimplementing BIMbecause they lack access to the people with the right knowledge of implementing BIM strategy. This is risky considering that BIM adoption can cost the construction company time and money. So, what can companies do to make BIM adoption easy? The first step would be to create a BIM adoption roadmap to guide companies in their implementation process. How To Create A BIM Adoption Roadmap? Understandthe value of BIM Investing in BIM is expensive, considering that companies need to invest in software, technology infrastructure, and people with specialized skills. Hence, it is prudent to understand its significance first. One way to determine its value is to develop a pilot use case. For example, use it to optimize the design for a smaller, contained project and see how it delivers values. This will enable the companies to determine how they can optimize the usage of BIM on a wider scale. Digitize processes To ensure full value from the BIM adoption, companies must digitize a range of their processes. BIM can help drive agile decision-making. It can help teams collaborate better and communicate more meaningfully. It can promote transparency in reporting. All this needs a change of organizational processes to deliver maximum impact. Digitizing processes will help the construction company create the enabling infrastructure to make the most of BIMs considerable power. Establish data-sharing standards BIM can be adopted only when data on design, costs, and schedules exists. However, inconsistent data sets can pose a challenge in generating insights and in the seamless adoption of BIM. Hence, companies must establish data-sharing standards and agree upon uniform conventions, especially if the construction is happening in different areas. This will reduce confusion and miscommunication between various stakeholders and improve efficiency. Promote collaboration between different stakeholders Construction activity is largely fragmented. Most teams are concerned with their scope of work, ignoring the larger impact that could have on other teams. To ensure the seamless implementation of BIM, all stakeholders must identify ways to collaborate continuously. BIM offers the opportunity to create a single-source-of-truth that can become the common ground to ensure that all the respective stakeholders are working in collaboration. Set a formal mechanism to improve collaboration. Take theUK Governments Construction Industry Council(CIC) BIM Protocol, for example. It is a standardized supplementary legal agreement for common construction contracts. The protocol demands that all the stakeholders obligations and limitations are clearly mentioned and shows the point of contact for managing all the data that BIM incorporates at each stage of the project. Keep the communication ongoing Communication is crucial forsuccessful BIM adoption. Reviveprocesses to drive ongoing communication between all the stakeholders. Leverage connected technologies to provide anytime, anywhere access to information for all the stakeholders, so they can communicate in real-time and accelerate the speed of BIM adoption. Ensure every stakeholder understands BIM Understanding the scope of BIM is vital for its successful adoption. Lack of BIM skills can slow down the process. Ensure that all stakeholders understand BIM and its implications well as it is the core of the digitized construction future. Upskilling the existing stakeholders through hands-on training is one way to make sure that everyone possesses the necessary skills. Of course, this is easier said than done. You could engage an experiencedBIM consultantorganization to make this process happen smoothly. Such a partner would drive the initial projects on the power of their own experience. As that happens, you get the opportunity to learn from them. If the partner has a local presence, they can help you refine your own processes and handhold you as you feel your way into the transformed BIM landscape. This could carry on for as long as is necessary for you to get your own BIM act in order. Be prepared for change BIM adoption goes beyond adopting the technology. It necessitates change management at an organizational level. The management will have to create a culture where employees understand the value of BIM and are willing to learn new skills to accelerate the process of implementation. Share information about how BIM will help them do their jobs better on an ongoing basis, so they are aware of its importance and more open to its adoption. BIM holds a lot of promise. But the solution is investment-intensive needing time, money, and effort to get right. Its not always possible for small and mid-sized American construction companies, especially those in the smaller centers, to hire technology resources to guide them. But BIM adoption requires guidance from real experts. Without that, a company risks running an expensive experiment. Thats where an experiencedBIM consultantcan help. A BIM consultant understands the needs of the construction company and advises on the ideal roadmap to follow. That could make a crucial difference to your BIM strategy.

Developers assign costs for every stage of the planning to determine the costs, feasibility, and direction of the project. That enables the construction company to build a perspective of how the project will come together over time. Construction companies call it part-science and part-art. There are two main approaches to it. The cost approach:Cost estimation can safely be called the cornerstone of conceptual estimating. Over 70% to 80% of the costs are determined during the pre-construction stage itself. It gives the developers an overview of the total budget and the potential for cost overruns in the project. It also enables developers to start planning for ways to work within a limited budget. In the current economic scenario, it is definitely advisable to have a cost estimate prepared for the projects on the floor to have a template to aim for at all times. The design approach: In the design approach, the construction company creates a detailed design based on the written scope and then proceeds with the construction. The concept is the main differentiator in this process. How Can BIM Help With Conceptual Estimating? BIM software comes with in-built estimating features that can help construction companies estimate better: Cost-savings According to McKinsey, large construction projects take 20% more time to finish, and 80% of the time goes over budget. They, and we, believe that BIM can help in solving these issues. It can shorten the duration of a project and save on effort and material costs. A 5D model of a project, for instance, can help builders get an overview of the projects total cost as tied to the schedule. Take the UKsCrossrail project, for example. The full-lifecycle BIM approach adopted for the project is estimated tohave saved 20% on design and construction and 40% on operations and maintenance costs. Closer to home, the Nagpur Metro Rail project is being credited with driving savings of an estimated Rs 1552 crores by using advanced technology like BIM. Automating the process Research shows that manual estimation can take up 50% to 80% of the time during the cost estimation stage. Additionally, manual estimating can also be prone to human errors such as inaccurate drawing interpretations during measurement. BIM enables automatic quantification, i.e. automating the quantification process that involves tallying components from printed drawing sets, or CAD drawings and using estimators to come up with a project cost estimate. It improves the plan efficiency of the project by removing duplication and reducing the chances of human errors. It can also minimize cost variation that normally occurs due to errors. This can help improve adherence to planned estimates, a key advantage in managing financing and cash flows. It can also help ensure more rational vendor billing and payments. Saving time Considering that BIM automates the steps such as manually entering the quantities and pricing, the estimators can save time on conceptual estimating. As the estimated quantities and pricing are linked to BIM, estimators do not have to update the quantities manually; neither do they have to update the pricing manually. It gets updated automatically. Providing a detailed estimate of a significant project can be quite cumbersome. Thats where BIM comes to rescue. Lets look at a complexexample. The IT giant  TCS was looking to redo a significant portion of a campus spread over 74,000 sq. ft. But the designs available to them were from the planning stage, whereas the as-built campus was substantially different. They used BIM to build a model focused on the architectural, structural, and services components. This was designed to be used for Clash Detection and Resolution (CDR) as the new designs and plans took shape. The estimated time frame for the completion of the CDR phase of the project through the conventional method was over three months. By using BIM, this phase was completed in 1 month -a time saving of 66%! Detectingerrors early-on BIM helps in managing risks, design errors, quality, and budget of the project. The intuitive design of BIM gives users a better view of the design and detects risks that can be addressed early on to avoid any challenges during construction. Lets consider a 40-acre project with a site of 30-feet elevation. There would be dozens of buildings and structures on that site. The entire information may be hand-drawn. When the sketch gets digitized and modeled with BIM, the estimators can calculate the cost and provide conceptual estimates that show the probable elevation issues that the developer could face during construction. Instances like these help construction companies to mitigate risks at an early stage. Conclusion BIM, if used in the right manner, can enable construction companies to save an average of 5% of operating costs per annum. It offers multiple benefits ranging from increasing ROI to reducing change orders and requests for information through the process of construction. It also promotes more communication and effective collaboration across various stakeholders involved in the conceptual estimation. BIM can completely change the way conceptual estimation is done. It can change the way estimators plan and build the project. For any assistance in integrating BIM with the conceptual estimation process, contact us. We will guide you through the process, just like we have done for dozens of other projects.

Reports state the BIM market may grow at a CAGR of 15% in the next 4 years. In a sector where challenges across profitability, project management, worker safety, and risk management are rife, BIM opens up new ways of approaching thedesign and documentationof various types of building projects. By delivering an intelligentdigitalrepresentation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility, it empowers designers, installers, and cost consultants to take a comprehensive view of the actual elements of a construction project. This has long been known to help companies optimize material costs, plan (and deliver) projects better, and be more sustainable. This post isnt about that though. Its about how BIM can help them win more bids! Read on to find out how! Opening doors to a new way of project management BIM is so much more than just a point technology system; it is a complex design and construction platform that provides architects, engineers, and construction professionals the insight and tools needed to plan, design, construct, and manage the infrastructure while creating innovative buildings of the future. The numerous benefits BIM offers are well known, but bear repeating just the same for the impact they could have on bid preparation and economic success: Improves communication and collaboration between construction workers and managers while paving the way for greater efficiency making time estimates easier and more predictable. Enhances estimation across materials, shipping, labor, and more  making costs more predictable and manageable Eliminates on-site rework, saves time thereby keeping committed schedules on track, budgets in check, and maximizing ROI Streamlines the construction workflow while reducing the chances of human error, project delays, and costly repairs making it easier to bid with confidence Supports easy interoperability and flexibility, and facilitates customization for higher quality results thus increasing the transparency of progress monitoring and providing early warnings of things going off track and the reason for the delay Aids in the timely and successful execution of complex construction projects by improving communication between all the stakeholders and establishing a single frame of reference  Shorter project lifecycles = more opportunities to close Of all the capabilities that modern BIM systems offer, the key promise of the solution in the context of making plans and estimates is the same: to shorten the construction project lifecycle and bring predictability to the process. This means many things: Better collaboration: BIM technology is key to bagging more projects in an increasingly competitive industry. Cloud-based BIM solutions allow designers and engineers to unlock efficiencies through a centralized project management system. By always staying on the page, they can be updated about the latest timelines and budget, work together to resolve errors in real-time while avoiding costly mistakes and reducing rework. Fewer errors and rework can help construction companies project a more professional image and build customer trust that can lead to stronger ongoing relationships. A single source of truth: Since all relevant information, including models, estimates, and design notes are stored in a single repository, architects and engineers no longer have to engage in back-and-forth calls and emails to discuss issues and opportunities. They can refer to a single source of truth to make critical decisions and improve the speed and efficiency with which they bring projects to closure. Providing this degree of transparency about ongoing work to the project owners (developers, government agencies, etc.) can be a great differentiator. Standardized workflows: Through streamlined workflows, BIM helps in creating and managing all of the information on a project  before, during, and after construction. Such standardization eliminates the need for engineers to depend on manual or repetitive tasks to progress the project through its lifecycle, helping accelerate the speed and accuracy with which projects are completed. The project owners get access to the most complete and updated information at all times in an easy to visualize manner, showing you in the best possible light. Streamlined risk management: The ability to construct buildings based on the most up-to-date plans and workflow makes visualizing problems easier. Since BIM allows contractors to virtually construct projects, they are in a better position to identify roadblocks and plan for workarounds - before construction starts. You can not only predict potential construction hazards; they can also prevent them by adjusting the design. This is an obvious advantage for project delivery, but highlighting problems early in the cycle in such a transparent manner can also help the project owners make decisions on project expansions, future phases, etc., and open up new opportunities. Faster construction: Because BIM allows companies to create interactive models that clearly state how the project will look in the real world, it enables better visualizations and transparent project details. Because these models are a true reflection of the actual project, it helps in removing doubt while enabling faster decision-making. Companies can accelerate the design process while saving substantial time in construction. Whats more, finishing a project on time (or before time) speeds up eventual ROI as the structure can be used immediately. Your reputation improves, resources get freed up, and cash flows get unlocked, all of which can help in getting more business. Obviously, there is no doubt about the fact that BIM delivers immense value to construction companies: right from improved quality and function of design, increased understanding of solutions, better collaboration and documentation, better planning, improved productivity, and more. BIM 3D models and real-world representations make it easy to visualize the project. These benefits help in eliminating the chances of construction issues, delays, and rework, and allowing companies to finish projects faster, but BIM also helps companies win more bids, and set themselves up for success.

The system should allow the seamless flow of data from various sites to central locations and ensure that future DMRC projects are completed within the stipulated time and budget. The system will be integrated with Autodesk BIM 360 design models and Oracle Primavera project schedules, so project officials can access personalized dashboards and interfaces. The announcement followed close on the heels of a Union Budget where the Government allocated $1.5 trillion for infrastructure development. Indias ambitions demand extensive, powerful, and intelligent infrastructure. In that light, some of the leading infrastructure projects in the country are looking beyond merely building facilities. They are looking to implement capabilities to become more efficient, transparent, and future-ready.  Although India emphasizes infrastructure development, it grapples with issues such as time delays and cost overruns. There are also other pain points such as inaccurate contract documents, getting clearances from different departments, lack of labour productivity monitoring, etc. These issues can be resolved with Integrated Project Management Systems. With DMRC paving the way for using technology such as Building Information Management (BIM) and the Governments push to infrastructure growth, we believe that solutions like IPMS will become more common in India. How Can IPMS Boost Indias Infrastructure Projects? Promote transparency Transparency is now essential in public infrastructure projects as the government (and citizens) view public investments in a new light. Considering that multiple stakeholders from various departments are involved in a project, and disparate systems are used to manage the project, there are chances of data or documents going amiss during the process. The numerous hand-offs and miscommunication between the stakeholders could lead to more ambiguity. This creates room for inefficiency, duplication, waste, and mala fide intentions. Thats why an integrated project management system is critical. The cloud-based systems can store all kinds of data and provides access to all the relevant stakeholders. Considering that each workflow will be mapped with each task and process, there is minimal scope for missing documents or data during hand-offs. Using an integrated project management system will also ensure that every stakeholder involved in the project is aware of the common objective and visibly works towards fulfilling it. Improve scheduling Gone are the days when infrastructure projects were expected to not meet the published schedule. Slowly (but surely) the pressure is growing on everyone involved to deliver fast and stay on track. Integrated project management allows stakeholders to set up schedules and deadlines for tasks that are interdependent. Sometimes the scope could change during the project. In such cases, IPMS will allow the stakeholders to adjust the scheduling accordingly. Organizations can use 4D BIM planning and scheduling to visually track the projects progress and get better control over it. The objective is to ensure that stakeholders are aware of deadlines and the progress towards them, so they adhere to them. Improve collaboration Traditionally, teams in such large projects function in silos. This creates communication gaps and makes collaboration harder. Miscommunications cause errors, gaps, and duplication of effort. An inability to collaborate effectively creates a loss of synergies and unmet potential. These challenges can derail the projects progress if not addressed immediately. Thats where integrated project management helps. IPMS acts as a glue that holds the various teams together. It allows different stakeholders across the organization to focus on common goals and address the common challenges that delay the project completion. These systems are backed by features such as document management that allow stakeholders to exchange information between different teams seamlessly and securely. Reduces operational costs and increases profitability Working in silos and the lack of communication could lead to communication gaps and unnecessary rework and delays. Rework is costly and time-consuming as it consumes 30% of the work done by organizations. Organizations can avoid such wasted operational costs by using integrated project management systems. Considering that every stakeholder is involved in the project from the beginning, they can identify potential issues at the start of the project itself. This gives them time to eliminate last-minute rework. By reducing the instances of rework, organizations can bring the budget under control and earn profits. Reduces material and resource wastage Every year 13 million tonnes of unused material goes to waste at construction sites. This also escalates the cost of the project and has an indirect impact on project earnings. Organizations can prevent such colossal wastage by integrating project management practices with tools such as BIM to create more comprehensive and transparent plans. This will help them control how much material is really needed at each stage of the project. Since the resource estimates can be tied more directly to the project plan, just-in-time stocking can be implemented, making cash flows more predictable and efficient.  Conclusion The implementation of Integrated Project Management might differ for every project depending upon its scale and complexity. However, the best practices for implementing it remain almost the same. It begins with: Defining the scope of the project Creating a project plan to document the plans and processes associated with the project Documenting how to execute the project Measuring and monitoring the performance And creating a change control document in which all the change requests and project impact are recorded Most importantly, the organization managing the project must leverage BIM to improve communication and collaboration among the different stakeholders. 4 The DMRC project looks set to become a guide for other infrastructure projects in the country by making project management more intelligent, responsive, transparent, and integrated into construction progress. Nagpur Metro project for MAHA Metro, another project that we at Excelize, are proud of having contributed to, set new benchmarks of schedule adherence and cost control by leveraging the power of BIM. Such projects show that the future of Indian public infrastructure may well be smarter and integrated!

LOD working Group formed byBIM Forum started developing the LOD framework into a consensus-based standard. It helps to define the reliability of the information contained in a BIM at the assembly and component levels. In the first attempt, the group interpreted the basic LOD definitions of AIA for each building system and subsystem. Then they compiled examples to illustrate the interpretations. They developed the specifications to address model element geometry by considering quantity take-off,3D coordination, and 3D control and planning, the three most common uses. According to the AIA, the LOD framework can help efficient communication, as it recognizes that various elements of the project will develop at different rates. Content required for BIM Modeling levels elements are defined below by the LOD framework: LOD 100:The model element can be graphically represented in the model using a symbol or other graphic representation. However, it cannot fulfill the requirements for LOD 200. LOD 200:The Model Element is graphically represented as a generic system, object, or assembly with the proper size, quantities, shape, orientation, and location within the Model. We can also attach the non-graphic information to the Model element. LOD 300:Here the Model Element is graphically represented as a specific system, object, or assembly in terms of size, shape, quantity, orientation, and location within the Model. LOD 400:The model element here is graphically represented as a specific system, object, or assembly with appropriate size, shape, quantity, and location. Orientation is represented by detailing, fabrication, installation, and assembly information. LOD 500:The Model Element here is a field verified representation in terms of shape, size, quantity, location, and orientation. DIFFERENT USES OF LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT IN BIM There are some issues that are faced by the LOD framework when theBIM model is used for communication or collaboration. That means the problems arise when someone other than the author extracts information from the BIM. Building systems and components develop from a vague conceptual idea to a precise description during the design process. In the past, there was no simple solution to designate where a model element is along this path. Nobody other than the author knows it. The precision at which an element is modeled may be easily misinterpreted. There may be hand drawings that range from pen strokes on a napkin to hard lines with dimensions called out. So the precision of the drawing can be easily understood from its appearance. However, a generic component that is placed approximately may look exactly the same as the specific component placed precisely. Therefore, something other than appearance is required to state the difference. We can infer information, which the author doesnt intend, from a BIM. Similarly, we can measure the unstated dimensions precisely. In earlier days, we had to put aside all these issues saying that some of the information in the model is unreliable and may not be relied on it. But, the LOD specification helps the author to state the reliability of given model elements clearly. In a collaborative environment, people other than the model author have to depend on information from the model to move their own work forward. So the model users are required to know at what time the information will be available to plan their work. LOD framework will help with this. The LOD specification can describe the state of development of different systems, assemblies, and components within aBIM providing an industry-developed standard.Thus it can address all these issues. This standard facilitates the detailed definition of BIM milestones and deliverables and thereby improves efficiency and effectiveness in communication and execution. The level of detail of abuilding information modelimproves along with the progress of the project. From a simple design intent model, it develops through a detailedvirtual construction model, then an operational model. Various aspects of the model will develop at various rates. The development may pass through different members of the project team from the employer to the contractor, consultants, and suppliers, and finally back to the employer.

At the same time, facility managers are also getting acquainted with how BIM implementation is not limited to the construction phase. In fact, after project completion, the data repository containing asset history, operation and maintenance related information is valuable for asset management. The role of BIM in disaster management and recovery based on the asset information is notable. Construction technology is advancing rapidly and helping us build better. However, natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and tornadoes are beyond our control. The disaster may be inevitable, but the damage to the asset and subsequent financial losses can be minimized greatly. What-if scenarios can be simulated using BIM models from the planning stage itself for building and infrastructure utilities. We have also witnessed cases of ill-management in fire accidents. In such scenarios, lack of asset information and delayed evacuation has resulted in higher injuries and death tolls. Having access to the BIM model for the building/ property and using the information to recover from the disaster can be truly beneficial. Today, BIMs information storehouse can be used by facility managers for disaster planning and management. Facility managers and emergency response teams can make quick decisions with the help of BIM data on floor plans, the MEP systems and real-time asset information. The accurate building information and timely communication can help facility managers tackle fire accidents and other emergencies. For example, the geometric and topological information of the building through BIM can give a clearer perspective to the emergency response team in case of fire accidents. When firefighters have a detailed layout and other asset information such as functional doors and elevators, they can navigate the building easily and prepare for evacuation and safety measures effectively. BIMs real-time information can also help in post-disaster recovery. For example, the emergency response team can use asset information from BIM such as damage to walls and electrical wires due to flooding. With this information, the team can take necessary action to avoid further losses and plan rapid asset recovery. To conclude, state-of-the-art technology helps us achieve robust construction. But we need to build sustainable assets for a better future. BIM for construction, if used effectively, can help us construct disaster-resilient buildings, enhance consumer protection and ensure a safer environment for the community also BIM isan effective tool for renovation projects.  5 Examples of BIM Adoption in USA that demonstrate clear benefits BIM An Effective Tool for Renovation Projects  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

The industry exemplifies the building blocks of our communities, and, from a broader perspective, is a foundation of the nation's economy. That said, unlike other industries, the construction industry has been sluggish to adopt new technologies and, perhaps, has never experienced a significant transformation for that reason. Consequently, productivity has stagnated over the past four decades, and in some cases, even sank. In some documented studies, its been reported that the productivity gains in the construction industry are only half as much as for all other sectors. The construction industry also faces several important questions, such as climate change, sustainability, lagging productivity, and financial pressure. Inefficiencies can be identified in almost every area of the construction ecosystem, beginning from design through to implementation. These inefficiencies give rise to increased costs and environmental impacts like wastage of materials, inefficient space allocation, or increased pollution. However, this scenario seems set to transform radically very soon. Intense changes are already occurringalthough not yet on a broader scalebut in several aspects of the construction industry. It would be apt to say that the future is almost here but is not uniformly distributed. Lets take a look at the changes that technology will bring in. The Key is Digitization According to McKinsey, construction-technology companies have gained over $10 billion in funding. Such investments are pushing technological innovations ahead at a rapid pace. This promises to enable the industry to deliver grand projects like underwater railway tunnels, human-made islands, and other marvels. The impact is likely to be felt at the massive as well as the minute level. An increasing number of construction projects will integrate digital sensors, mobile devices, intelligent machines, and innovative software applicationsusually integrated withbuilding information modeling (BIM)to create data-driven strategies. One fascinating instance of digital technologies facilitating the construction industry is the restoration of one of the world's key landmarks: Notre Dame. After the disastrous fire last year, discussions concerning its renovation entered the modern age extremely fast. In 2015, an Art History professor produced a billion data points by 3D laser scanning the complete cathedral and formulating a high-resolution digital blueprint. His efforts helped in mapping the building into models with utmost precision, allowing for insightful decision-making and planning for the necessary renewal. New tools and technologies in the digital space will help construction organizations enhance productivity, lessen project delays, and further improve buildings' quality and enhance safety, working conditions, and environmental compatibility. Technology Revolutionizing Construction Phases Technology is revolutionizing three crucial life cycle phases of every construction project. All through the design and engineering stage, its apparent now that BIM recognizes possible design clashes and constructability problems, thus preventing costly rework. Its also becoming increasingly obvious that BIM enhances the tendering process by making all the information increasingly transparent and accessible. An attention-grabbing instance is that of Crossrail. It is one of the most complex and most significant infrastructure projects involved in constructing a critical underground line across London. During this project, the designers and engineers utilized a centralized set of connected BIM databases to incorporate roughly 1.7 million CAD files into a single information model to allow vendors to bid and plan better. During the construction stage, drones are likely to be utilized to survey and inspect the construction site. 3D printers will prefabricate several building components. The materials, equipment, and workers will be regularly tracked using GPS and RFID to optimize workflows, improve real-time locational awareness, and optimize inventory levels. Robots and autonomous vehicles will carry out more building work. Aerial mapping or 3D laser scanning can be effectively used to compare work in progress with a virtual model, allowing prompt corrections and minimizing unnecessary rework. During the operations stage, embedded sensors will be leveraged to inspect assets, check for deterioration, assist predictive maintenance, and continuously update central databases. Augmented Reality will further guide maintenance crews. The big data (collected from sensors, energy consumption, etc.) will be subjected to advanced analytics tooptimize decision-makingand boost operational efficiency. Its true, the adoption of these transformative construction technologies has been slow. While few construction companies have faced some struggle in adopting, the others who had employed these technologies faced a hard time to capture all the possible benefits. However, gradually, these obstacles will fall. As technology adoption grows, productivity gains will become apparent and outcomes will improve visibility. The Way Forward for Construction Industry Connected technologies and a rise in associated investments will help construction technology companies fine-tune their offerings, acquire more customers, demonstrate more value, and articulate their benefits better. As technology becomes more visible, it will help drive adoption in the wider construction sector. Construction companies will seek new operational efficiencies and better financial outcomes by utilizing technology in the planning, delivery, and operation of construction projects and gain substantial business value. McKinseysays that $ 10 billion will be invested in construction technology companies. This will likely help bring about a paradigm shift in how Indian construction companies look at technology.

The major problem faced by the construction industry is the inability to complete the construction projects on time and within the budget. There are several factors in the construction field that lead to time and cost overrun. Poor planning and scheduling, as well as unprofessional site management of contractors, cause the delay in construction and it will result in financial loss to the owners.The important factors that lead to wastage of time are inefficient project planning and scheduling, lack of contractor experience, improper site management and supervision, incredible subcontractors, and delayed delivery of materials, which could be avoided through the appropriate implementation of BIM Modeling services. Change in design by the owner, delay in site delivery, a progress payment, approving design documents and performing inspection and testing, and ineffective communication and coordination with other parties. The problems in planning and scheduling complexity of design and lack of control over the site resource allocations are also some of the top factors that cause time overruns. ENABLES DESIGN CHANGES Through BIM Modeling services quick changes in design could be made if any possible problem is found on the construction site. FACILITATES COST ESTIMATION: Using this technology, the design intent of a building can be checked both quantitatively and qualitatively, and thus BIMcost estimating processcan be made early. REDUCES REWORK: Rework is the main fact that leads to wastage of time and money in the construction industry. BIM Modeling services help in updating and synchronizing any design automatically. It will reduce the drawing errors and thus minimize the possibilities of rework. So reducing human errors and avoiding reworking will help the industry to save time and money significantly. ENHANCES PRODUCTIVITY Implementation of BIM concept can increase the efficiency and productivity of the delivery process as well as the constructed facility. As the construction issues can be eliminated at an earlier stage, the request for a design change, team conflicts, and rebuilding will be reduced. The designers can make design decisions on the spatial experience of theBIM-based models. It can result in a massive impact on the cost of the construction. AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE DATA: The components in a BIM model know how to act and interact with other components. For example, in a BIM model, a room, more than an abstract concept, is a unique space with other building components such as floors, walls, and ceilings. InBIM Modeling services, the model is a complex database with geometric information and non-graphic data and room is a database element. So, if the designers change any model element, the changes in all views are automatically coordinated by BIM software. BIM MODELING SERVICES PROVIDES DIGITAL VISUALIZATION: The key benefit of BIM Modeling services is that it helps owners and AEC professionals with digital visualization, design, simulation, and analysis of the physical and functional features of a project before they are constructed. So they get an idea of how the building will come together before the work starts. It reduces the change in design during construction, which will result in time and cost-saving. While CAD uses software tools to createdigital 2D or 3D drawings, BIM Modeling services provide a new way of working with designs and intelligent objects created.

As all the stakeholders get a clear vision of the project from the BIM model, they can be informed faster.

While big players may be able to allocate a portion of their wallets to experiment with digital tools and techniques, a good majority of mid-size companies are not really in a position to adopt that stance. A combination of factors such as harsh and remote work environments that take away the ability to set up a feasible digital infrastructure, limited R&D budgets, entrenched working practices, and aninability to hire technical staffhinder the growth prospects of digital considerably for mid-size companies in the construction sector. This is even truer of construction companies located away from the East and West Coast tech-centers like Silicon Valley or New York. Additionally, this sector is also widely regarded as one of the most fragmented businesses in light of its operational model. Every project may involve different suppliers, vendors, designers, contractors, and sub-contractors all following their own decentralized processes and standards in operations. Unifying operations through digital solutions thus become a challenge as the IT team, such as it is, may have to continuously engage in on-boarding new stakeholders after every project and this will in turn require more training and infrastructure costs. But all is not gloomy as several businesses in this space have tasted success with their digital aspirations. It could either be a digital transformation of the whole business or parts of their operations or departments or some business units within the organization. So, how can others catch up with these winners? Here are 4 ways that have proven to work successfully in transforming mid-sized construction companies into digital-friendly enterprises. Improving productivity through collaborative platforms. Studies have shown that digital transformation can improve productivity by around15%in the construction sector. Field workers, supervisors, engineers, and contractors often have different checklists to validate for their daily tasks. These tasks are interconnected in several areas and delays or obstacles faced by one party can slow down the entire system. Collaborative work is highly impactful for enabling the timely completion of projects by helping boost the productivity levels of all stakeholders. By deploying digital platforms like BIM that automatically track and record progress, identify dependencies, manage schedules and notify relevant stakeholders of challenges, there can be huge improvements in collaboration as it brings about transparency and visibility into tasks of each. This allows for better management of resources and more effective work outcomes. Simplifying uniqueness Every engineering and construction project has a fair amount of unique needs and requirements be it in architectural planning, materials used, and labor skills needed. Many modern construction projects involve the installation of pre-built structures or units in the construction site under supervision for example steel frames, glass partitions, doors, and much more. The pre-built or prefabricated components are often built simultaneously with the construction progress but at a different location and finally transported to the construction site. The real-time visualization of spaces where structures will be installed, training for workers to install the pre-built structures, and eliminating manufacturing defects during prefabrication are very important in this aspect. By using digital platforms like BIM that integrate with tools that utilize Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), it is possible to address these challenges. From providing virtual real-time guidance and enabling workers to quickly learn about installation through interactive demos, construction companies can address the complex requirements of each project. IoT for employee safety and pro-active maintenance Safety laws are evolving to provide better working conditions for employees involved in dangerous roles like in construction. This change is beingaccelerated to accommodate the COVID-drivensocial distancing and contact tracing efforts. As a result, there is an increased focus on bringing in more safety management and automated maintenance equipment to the field to make lives safer for employees. From a digital perspective, Internet of Things or IoT enabled hardware sensors can relay crucial information such as temperature, air quality, hazardous material management, proximity alerts for dangerous places, etc. in real-time to help companies plan for emergencies and ensure the safety of all working in the field. IoT sensors also help in ensuring that construction equipment deployed in worksites such as heavy-duty cranes are in optimal working condition and get timely repairs. In fact, studies show that the market for IoT in the construction sector is expected to touch a massiveUSD 16.4 Billionby 2024. Real-time communication The growth in smartphone adoption amongst employees can help in accelerating digital transformation at a construction project. Expert guidance or instructions can be provided in real-time for complex engineering tasks through real-time conferencing. This allows companies to facilitate field workers to get access to live guidance and information about their work from specialists who may be locatedremotely thousands of miles awayfrom the work sites. Besides, there are digital solutions that help field supervisors track the progress of every task, assign remarks on progress metrics, report daily operational status to senior managers, request for allowances or assistance, and much more. In the past, all these required stakeholders to come together physically in one place, usually the construction site, to facilitate smooth operations. With the advent of digital, this whole process becomes less complex and more manageable remotely.BIMis a great example of such a solution that is designed for use offsite in collaboration with the onsite team. With the construction industry in the US alone expected to build nearlyUSD 1.3 Trillionworth of structures yearly, there are plenty of opportunities for mid-size and small construction companies to benefit from using digital for their operations. By leveraging the right technology for the right context and with the right advisory, digital transformation can become a crucial aid in helping construction businesses grow sustainably amidst tight competition.  5 areas of construction where technology can show dramatic impact Why It Has Just Become Harder For Construction Companies To Hire Tech Talent  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

In fact, asurvey by National Health Institutes (USA), shows that 15% of the total expenditure by companies, goes to cover the cost of construction injuries. The survey also suggests that the construction industry has almost 70% higher nonfatal injuries than any other industry. No wonder, safety assurance for workers, contractors, and other personnel, have always been critically important for Construction Companies. But the recent pandemic has made the situation even worse. Along with the existing risks at construction sites, theres now the fear of COVID infection. State and local governments are allowing construction companies to resume their projects. However, measures like social distancing, contact tracing, consistent risk assessments have become necessary. These add to the caution overhead. Therefore, construction companies need to be aware of the new safety mandates at construction sites. First, lets clarify that there have always been existing mandates for assuring safety at construction sites. Risk awareness, training for laborers and contractors, strategic communication, protective gear all fall under this umbrella. Technologies likeBIM (Building Information Modelling)have been helping construction companies comply with these mandates by allowing them to plan, track and monitor, and record better. It is also true that with safer sites and better plans, companies are also able to finish projects faster. Now, with a changed mandate at hand, it would be interesting to see how these tech solutions can continue to deliver value. Let us take a look at these changes and understand how technology can be aligned with them. Social Distancing:Social Distancing has to be the topmost on this list. One can expect basic guidelines and norms to prevent physical proximity to already be in place. However, there will be some additional factors that the safety mandate will have to include. Managing surface transmission is one such example. The workers and contractors may come into indirect contact because of surface transmission from the tools and other goods that enter the site. Visits to the worksite will also have to be reduced. Even during an unavoidable visit, everyone involved should be mindful of the necessary safety measures. Any face-to-face contact might also need to be monitored as well as timed. Moreover, the work shifts will have to be planned such that the workforce can commute in off-peak hours. Fortunately, BIM allows various construction and design activities to be carried offsite. Experts can collaborate for such planning. BIM models will also help with pre-planning for the construction. This will help optimize resource requirements and help reduce the on-site crowd to the extent possible. Work Accident Risk:With changes in shifts, and additional social distancing measures, the work accident risk might increase. Therefore, it is construction and installation plans must be devised more thoughtfully. Automated safety logistic checks can be run beforehand. This will allow the companies to understand the changed on-site risks. TheBIM models, powered with local and retained knowledge, can help the companies customize the construction processes as per the site limitations. Thus, even before the project is ready, the contractors and the workers would be aware of the workplace risks and be able to devise suitable safety measures. With each site having its own limitations, safety mandates can be implemented accordingly. Sanitization:This is an extension of the earlier point about surface transmission. The tools and surfaces will have to be regularly sanitized to avoid any such risks. Without a management and monitoring structure in place, this can lead to omissions and increased safety risks. The changed safety mandate would require the companies to devise a cost-effective sanitization plan. Regular deep cleaning might be needed. Provisions will have to be made so that every person or potentially infected surface entering the premises is properly sanitized. The construction companies can, potentially, integrate BIM with their existing decision support systems. This will help them understand and plan material arrivals and labor safety and sanitation measures (LSS). Knowing the number of resources that would need to be deployed in advance can also help companies plan sanitization effectively. Contract Tracing:Another big safety need would be to provide for contact tracing. This means, preventing transmission by tracing and assessing the areas and groups that could have been exposed to COVID. If a worker is tested positive, post joining the work, there might be other co-workers and their near ones who might be exposed to the virus. Applications are being developed to allow self-registration and better contact tracing of workers. This will help the companies to monitor their COVID-readiness. They can send suitable alerts in case of any exposure. Contact tracing protocols cannot be avoided especially at a high-risk place like a construction site. Technology can prove to be a big relief and allow construction companies to take more nuanced and targeted actions rather than close the entire site down. Team Communication:Improper communication has always been a problem in a high-stress environment like construction sites. With the COVID situation, the stress has escalated manifold. Therefore, it is mandatory for employee safety that the tasks and processes are clearly communicated. Workers that might already be a little anxious about infections, sanitizations, etc., would not want to add to their cognitive load. Proper communication will help ease that burden. BIM essentially condenses much of the stress and fuss related to the job plans, before the work begins. With the help of clear models, companies can better define the upcoming tasks for all the contractors and workers. Therefore, the workplace would be a less stressful place. Accident Investigation:The companies will have to be ready for any unfortunate events despite the above-discussed measures. This is an essential mandate that cannot be taken lightly. Provisions to investigate accidents and safety failures will have to be placed at all costs. BIM can help with emergency measures to deal with on-site accidents. It can also provide comprehensive and near real-time data on the site that can assist with analyzing why the accident occurred in the first place. Projects cannot remain stalled forever. However, construction companies cant also proceed without adequate safety measures. With newer physical and mental health concerns, the safety mandates will also be refreshed. Technology like BIM can be a powerful ally in this regard. Ultimately, safe workers would construct safer buildings.

As the Indian government has planned to launch smart solutions to meet the need of growing urbanization and has approved 100 smart cities project in India. Many industry experts contributed different solutions to the challenges highlightedin the article. Like, Mr. Pratap Padode (@pratappadode)says, The Smart Cities mission and AMRUT are likely to infuse a total of Rs 400,000 crore, once integrated with other missions like Digital India, Swachh Bharat, Housing for All, etc. Mr. Kanwaljeet Singh, Business Development, Energy and Smart Cities, Schneider Electric Indiasays At present, only Lavasa near Pune can be classified as a smart city. Other cities (such as Mumbai and Delhi) are still in the process of upgrading their systems and could qualify as smart in the future. We have been talking to these cities about the best way to do this, following which they will come up with their procurement procedures,saysAamer Azeemi, Managing Director, Cisco,adding that the company is in discussion with many cities.We have done the complete smart city planning for four cities in the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor,he shares. Similarly under the Utility and Solutions section where there are two components to any smart city: Physical infrastructure and software. Every city, from ancient times to now, has required roads, water, power, parks, security, transportation, shopping, food production, and services of different types for its citizens. What has changed is that all these facilities can now be designed using the analysis of data. Therefore, you get smarter roads where traffic lights are coordinated with the amount of traffic and smarter water by measuring the amount of water being consumed and then planning how much to buy, how much to clean and purify, and how much to store and distribute. While smarter power and the fine granular measurement can improve load factors and reduce electricity cost, smarter grids for electricity distribution improve the resiliency of power networks. Additionally, smarter transportation, agriculture, and services can be possible by backing every decision with data collection and analytics. This considered,the benefits building information modeling (BIM)offers at the various stage are proven.It can play a significant role to make smart cities a success,affirmsSonali Dhopte, Director, Excelize.She highlights some goals for BIM adoption or implementation in smart cities: At the design stage: Visualisation of the project leads to a reduction in coordination time; reduction in time by design changes; accuracy in data used for construction as BIM lets us build virtually before building physically. At construction stage: Reduction in rework at site owing to clash detection and resolution; the accuracy of Bill of Quantities (BOQ) and consequently material procurement; delay monitoring through4D construction simulation; availability of an as-built model for facility management. At maintenance stage: Integration of design data with maintenance data; the impact of any updates or renovations can be assessed against the data available in the BIM model.

Thats not the only feather in its cap. Nagpur Metro is being regarded as the greenest metro system in India. Theres no doubt that the Nagpur Metro project stands as the perfect example for megaprojects in India and the rest of the world.So, what are the lessons we can learn? Factors that contributed to the successful completion of the project: 1.Effectiveness of consultation with stakeholders:This is a public infrastructure project first and last. Its critical to make room for the role of the public to ensure success. From the conceptualization stage, the communication between the project leaders and the public should be strong. The public should understand the plans, the benefits to them, and the likely hardships they may encounter along the construction phase. No project of this size is trouble-free. Having the public in the projects corner when the inevitable problems surface can be a critical advantage. This facet was one of the most significant characteristics of the Nagpur Metro project. 2.Use of technology:The power ofBIMwas used by Nagpur metro to make the construction of the metro more secure, faster, and qualitatively better. This helped the team plan better, be more efficient with resource utilization, collaborate better, and prevent avoidable clashes and rework. This was key to being able to deliver a fast, efficient, and on-budget project. BIM has not only been available and beneficial during construction but will play an equally important role in the operation & maintenance phase of the project. It has effectively addressed the massive document management challenge for the project. Nagpur Metro project is the first such effort in India to adopt the5D BIM technologyby incorporating ERP with BIM and various world-class software for project management. The single source of truth provided by the BIM platform enabled the entire team of Nagpur Metro rail project to get the right data at the right time for productive decision making. 3.Intensive tracking and monitoring:Projects of this size are never lacking for the involvement of experts with experience in railway and other metro projects. The challenge has often been, how to make the best use of their expertise? How to ensure that their expertise is called upon just when it is likely to have the maximum impact? This is where BIM helped by providing the project managers transparent visibility into the real-time status of the project at all times. Regular tracking of work undertaken by the consultants and workers was scheduled. This provided clear visibility of likely problems in time for action to be taken to mitigate their impact. Expert help could be proactively pulled in to offer fixes or workarounds before the problem got out of hand. This also made it possible to communicate the issues and the solutions to all the involved parties well in time. This also contributed to `bridging the communication gap and accelerating the tasks. The Nagpur metro is a great example of quality, effectiveness, efficiency, and speed. It got that way by utilizing globally tested digital technologies, latest construction tools and techniques, green initiatives, and the passion and skills of its employees. Nagpur Metro Rail Project was planned, designed, and executed with many innovative and unique features. 1.A multi-layered metro project:Nagpur Metro is a multi-layered metro with Indias first four-layer transport system. The continuous and ongoing work of the flyovers, roads, highways and the metro are coming up in a similar vertical space. The three and four-layer transport framework will be a modern wonder when completed. 2.Greenest metro in India:The sustainable solutions used in developing the Nagpur metro makes it the greenest metro in India. 65% of the energy requirements of the Nagpur Metro project are met from the solar panels attached on the rooftop of the metro rail, depot boundary walls, stations, depot shed, etc. The energy generated from the system is also added back to the grid and the power required is drawn from local sources.The project also recycles every single drop of water it uses. 3.Fastest completed project:The Nagpur Metro project is the fastest completed project of its type. The project foundation was laid in 2015 and the trial runs were held within just 27 months. This is an unprecedented pace for such a massive project. 4.Ratings:All stations, administrative buildings, and depots have been planned and designed to achieve maximum rating from the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). All Green Norms are being implemented and observed for energy & water efficiency, enhanced comfort, wastewater management, and 100% segregation of waste at source. The project has admirable sustainable and economic features baked into it right from its inception phase. And that is perhaps the biggest lesson to learn from it. Laurels are not achieved by accident. They have to be planned for, the details pored over and then transformed into reality with lots of effort and teamwork. Im fortunate to have been a part of this path-breaking project. And I dont think I will ever tire of saying that!

For this post, lets consider that multi-family housing is a type of housing facility where multiple housing units are built within one building or a few buildings within one complex. In some cases, units in a multi-family residential building are classified as condominiums. Here typically the units are owner individually instead of renting from a single apartment building owner. Many communities incorporate multi-family residences such as cohousing projects. From the perspective of their construction though, lets consider that some common parameters apply to all multi-family housing. The residential space and particularly the multi-family sector holds incredible potential for development. In most developed nations the residential multi-family market is responsible for a significant portion of all construction activity. Of course, such a project has its complexity. The sheer size, scale, and delivery pressures are obvious issues. But while constructing a multi-family housing facility, a variety of other difficulties are encountered, such as: Coordinating with the multiple teams Integrating information Access to information Tracking and monitoring Timely action A massive amount of information is created during the construction and development stage and not every significant bit of it is recorded. Every individual contractor involved during the construction and development stage utilises various tools to produce and process the information applicable to them. In such a fragmented environment, a missing piece of data can prove disastrous for the project. This suggests the need for a centralised platform to share, exchange, and project information in real-time (or near real-time). In that context, BIM brings clear advantages to this construction and development process. As most here already know, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an intelligent 3D-model-based process that gives engineering, building, and development experts the insight and tools to productively plan, design, validate and collaborate while building. BIM is utilized to plan and document building and infrastructure designs. And obviously, multi-family residential projects can be improved with a well-thought BIM Modelling strategy. BIM gives a clear understanding of the materials utilised, the building life cycle of a specific structure, and the expense of building it. Better project coordination and collaboration with stakeholders, efficient work processes, 3D perceptions, and improved project results are just some of the advantages of using BIM processes. The other advantages include: Representation: By working with intelligent 3D models, it is possible to document some different highlights that 2D projects can't. With 3D models, sales teams can generate spontaneous visuals which act as a great marketing technique while sell multi-family developments.  Multi-family Detailing: The benefit of BIM is the capacity for creating details quickly. Data can be added to a current structure data model to communicate further information about the project. This is a great application for residential BIM modelling.  Time and money: When the whole team is working on a BIM model, loads of time can be saved by pulling data from the BIM files. Rather than starting similar work all over again in a new work process, data can be passed on to any person in need. All the important data can be found in a single location. As is evident, in the context of multi-family housing, every detail about the structure is transparently visible with BIM. The model can be utilised for analysis to explore structure options and to create visualizations that help stakeholders understand what the building will resemble before it is built. The model is then used to create the design documentation for construction. BIM not only helps the design and development teams work more efficiently and productively, but it also enables them to capture the information created during the process to benefit workflows and tasks. It allows them to improve operations and maintenance activities. BIM data can likewise improve procurement and resource planning. Its well known that BIM helps prevent clashes between teams working on different facets of construction like plumbing, electricals, HVAC, etc. With multi-family housing this is a significant benefit, given the added complexity of a variety of layouts and unit designs that may be in play across the entire campus. BIM is valuable not only while facilities are being built but also can help maintain existing structures too. Accessibility to facilities information is most vital for facilities management, and BIM provides exactly that. BIM technology helps in reducing the inconsistencies in the base data of the building as it comes up. And the value only grows as the information builds up as the structure does too. BIM incorporates all the modifications and alterations made over time, thereby giving the facilities managers and maintenance teams access to data that is accurate and complete. This becomes a massive advantage for large multi-family housing projects with day-to-day maintenance needs impacted by the lives and actions of so many residents. BIM technology is intended to support contractors and builders to construct more effectively. And as it happens, BIM fulfills just such a role in the construction of multi-family housing too.  5 things that have changed in construction 3 construction technology disruptions that will have to depend on BIM  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

Is BIM More Useful for Design than Construction? BIM or Building Information Modeling is rapidly becoming the must-adopt standard in building and construction projects. BIM, as a practice, spans the management of the physical structure as well as the other useful information of a construction project. The output of the process is what we refer to as BIM models. BIM is far more than mapping physical space. It incorporates embedded functionality and cost measurements within the plan. These models are the digital files that portray every part of the project and support decision-making throughout the cycle. Some well-known advantages of adopting BIM are:  Capture the most accurate representations of the location  Capture reality  Maintain control  Organize steps and processes  Better collaboration and communication  Model-based cost estimation  Improved coordination and clash detection  Reduced cost and mitigated risk  Stronger facility management  Improved construction sequencing  BIM has multiple advantages that are beneficial for the structure and planning of a construction project. There are a few principle areas where BIM can have an impact:  BIM enables visual representation at an early stage.  It enhances site planning and coordination  BIM helps for visual scheduling  It provides accurate estimation and operational cost savings  BIM helps to reduce costly errors  It helps to improve construction predictability  It permits visualizing the impact of changes in the design before construction  It allows efficient energy analysis But that said, the traditional sense has been that BIMs, model-based approach is utilized for both planning and collaboration. But is that, strictly speaking, true? Engineering and design are iterative procedures that have usually been manual. Architects, structural engineers and builders all need to view various snippets of information and utilize different layouts. BIM provides practical solutions to make easy changes whenever required. As the use of BIM is growing, the quality and nature of the information collected is increasing, as well. This collected data is precious for planning. BIM is useful not only for assessing a structure for the achievability of the project but also to provide an insight into the buildings performances in terms of constructability and functionality. BIM helps to integrate knowledge, framework, and business structures in a collaborative process. The possibility of having a digital portrayal of the physical structure in the design and planning stage enables the prior detection of blunders and more transparent evaluation of the design. The control during the preconstruction phase will guarantee constructability by detection of errors, alterations, and irregularities in the project. Building Information Modeling helps reduce frequent changes and cost issues; thus, it can economically achieve space planning and coordination. 3D visualizations enable effective communication in the planning and design phase. Some of the significant advantages of BIM utilization in the planning and design stage are the following. 1. Project visualization during the planning stage:Building Information Modeling tools empower proper project visualization and planning at the preconstruction stage. 3D simulation and visualization of the structure enable the clients to have a post-development visualization that facilitates simple modification before the beginning of the project. The overview of the project thus lowers the danger of time-consuming, unwanted and costly changes. 2. Assessment of cost based upon the project model:The incorporation of material specification facilitates effective construction cost assessment of the model-based project. The time-consuming challenges associated with cost assessment are effectively automated with the use of BIM. This enables estimators to focus on the most extreme element of significant worth that includes recognizing construction risk evaluation. But what about during the actual construction? As it happens, there are significant benefits from BIM at that stage too. 3. Lower expenses and risk:BIM helps to save a lot of money and make construction smoother and more efficient. The data storage libraries in BIM provide better coordination and a single source of truth that lowers the possibilities of using obsolete data by any team. This ensures early clash detection and prevention. Better coordination and collaboration between teams allows more efficient utilization of on-site resources. It also leads to a reduction in the labour expenses put into documentation and miscommunication. 4. More efficient construction: BIM helps to improve team collaboration and workflow productivity. BIM permits the specialists to access all the available data in a format they need. The frequent use of a single dataset implies that edits made in one configuration are automatically generated throughout the framework, removing the need to update various drafts as the project progresses. It further eliminates the necessity to manually produce other final-product documents such as schedules, colour-filled drawings and diagrams, and 3D models. These can be rendered quickly from the BIM database. 5. Less trial and error: Another benefit of BIM is the increasing number of simulation instruments that permit the designers to envision things such as the sunlight during various seasons or to measure the energy consumption of a building. BIM can do all the investigation, analysis, and modeling beforehand. The model also guarantees an ideal fit of components that are produced off-site )precast and prefabrication), permitting these components to be effortlessly bolted into place instead of creating them on site. BIM is one of the most reliable tools to share information in construction projects. It serves various purposes depending on the phase of a project, be it design or delivery. BIM is becoming ever more crucial to the digitization of the construction and development industry. Its fair to say that projects using BIM have a greater chance of success today.

Can BIM be the core of your Green Building strategy? Can BIM be the core of your Green Building strategy? Sustainable/green design is driving a sea of change in the construction industry across the globe. A Smart Market report says that Green Buildings enjoy an 8% savings in operating cost in the first year itself and that the building asset value also goes up by as much as 7%. This World Green Building Trends 2018 Smart Market Report projected that while 27% of the industry was doing more than 60% of their projects green in 2021, this number would grow to 47% -i.e. nearly half of all construction projects. This can be seen in a couple of different ways. One that the trend of Green Buildings is growing. These buildings are designed to be inherently more conscious and sustainable in how they use resources. They are typically LEED-certified and the focus is more on running them green. From our perspective, there is, of course, another angle to this too. That is, how can the process of construction itself be more environmentally conscious and green. This post is about how the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry can, and indeed already is, leverage BIM to support and promote the cause of green buildings in all ways. What is sustainable construction? The word sustainable has been so overused in the past decade that people have started to cringe at the mere mention of it. Everything from buildings to farming is shifting towards sustainability. Lets look at what sustainability in the construction industry means. Sustainable construction can be best defined as an attempt to meet the challenges and requirements of present-day infrastructure needs without adding a dent to the already stressed environment. It is far more than installing energy-efficient electrical systems or appliances. It is an attempt to meet the current needs without comprising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The sustainable or green design focuses on every aspect and element of the design and construction phases along with the future needs of operation and maintenance of a facility. BIM and Green Design The recent discussions in the U.S. between the American Institute of Architects Committee on the Environment (AIA/COTE) and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) reflects the growing focus on green or sustainable design. Perhaps its no coincidence that the US along with other countries like Finland, the UK, and Denmark have adopted BIM for the majority of their public infrastructure work. This focus on sustainability is visible elsewhere too. Indias current focus is on building smart cities. Public infrastructure development is underway in many Tier-II cities. Among the main focus areas of any smart city, the project is sustainable living. Sustainable living demands green buildings that thrive on optimum and intelligent utilization of the resources at hand. Role of BIM in Green Design Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a cutting-edge technology that is widely adopted by the construction industry worldwide for better planning, resource utilization, collaboration, and cost control. These attributes suggest that BIM could be leveraged for creating sustainable projects too. Heres how a connection can be established between sustainable construction and BIM: 1. Transparency during the design phase The shared model feature in BIM software helps in providing easy access to the design data for all the involved stakeholders. This allows the architects, engineers, builders, and designers to brainstorm upon the proposed materials and products that are going to be used in the project. In focus can be issues like whether the proposed options are environmentally conscious while delivering the needed functionality or whether an alternative can work better. The entire team can bring in their knowledge and expertise to find a sustainable BIM solution. 2. Greater efficiency during designing and construction The real-time sharing of data through the multidimensional model generated by BIM allows collaboration, simulation, and reviewing of workflows at every stage from inception to execution. This helps in increasing efficiency by saving time through clash detection and thereby reducing the overall likelihood of possible human errors or the need for rework. This saves resources, reduces wastage, and ensures work gets done faster -all helping to reduce the environmental footprint. The better planning that BIM promotes also helps drive better material procurement and utilization. Only as much material as is needed is ordered, only that much is stored on-site, and material wastage is less. This drives more conscious consumption of construction material and a reduced impact on the environment. 3. Performance monitoring during the operations phase The projects in the past faced difficulties in maintaining data about the changes made to the design during the construction phase. This created much trouble for those tasked with maintaining the building since they did not have a final design of the facility. However, the real-time data sharing feature of the BIM makes it easy to maintain a list of all the changes executed during the construction phase. This assists the building owner or manager to carry out maintenance work efficiently once the building is operational. This optimizes the ongoing resource utilization of the building and, hence, the environmental impact.  The construction industry worldwide is being swept up in the global movement to be more environmentally conscious. This is also a regulatory imperative. As this article should show, Building Information Modelling (BIM) could help construction companies achieve these green goals.

Moreover, among those who use architectural BIM modeling, about 83% of users have experienced a positive ROI on their investments. BIM presents designers with incredible opportunities to design and create more effectively by connecting the multi-dimensional model to the 2D drawing. Lets talk more about how architects use BIM for design. What does the BIM process look like for architects? BIM has played an important role in transforming design and construction projects. It allows design teams to work more efficiently and allows them to explore designs before they are built. Although every firm has standard operating procedures and manuals for BIM, the following are some of the core steps in the BIM process that architects usually follow: Predesign - The predesign stage is to determine if BIM can be used on the project. The first step is to have a BIM roadmap to define how the BIM tool fits into a company's larger strategy. The roadmap can help develop and improve the architect's workflow by documenting short- and long-term strategic goals. It helps identify ways to leverage BIM through building analysis simulation. Schematic model - After taking the necessary call on BIM, the architect starts creating the schematic model by using real elements in a BIM environment. Presentation of the schematic model - The architect then gives a walkthrough or rendering of the schematic model. Specific tools like Revit are used during this presentation. The team then finalizes the design after several tweaks. Schematic design - At this point, scheduling and estimating are done. Scheduling helps make sure that the building can be built in the allotted time and estimating helps track the cost of the project. However, it can be a very laborious process to count all the elements of a process project from a 2D plan. But BIM helps simplify this process and saves time. Interference checks and coordination reviews - In this phase of the design process, regular meetings are held between the architects, engineers, project managers, and construction managers. During these meetings, interference checks and coordination reviews are done. BIM provides a number of collaborative tools that make this process easier. Moreover, these meetings help catch any mistakes in the early design phase itself. Element ownership - Ownership of elements is another important factor to consider. It refers to figuring out which discipline modeled an element. The owner of a particular element, also known as model element author or MEA, needs to pay extra attention to the coordination of that element Construction - Construction is the final phase after the design is created. Since during the design phase, scheduling and estimating have been done, it means that items have been purchased and the schedule has been modified to complete the construction on time. During the construction phase, the construction manager and field superintendent collaborate with the design team to ensure that the design is implemented. BIM helps create a strong connection between design and construction and promotes collaboration. This results in making the journey from design to construction quite seamless. How BIM helps architects in the design process? A big reason why BIM proves beneficial in improving design is that it enables collaboration between the designers, owners, and builders. Having the same source of information improves the design, implementation, and decision-making process immensely. Some other ways in which BIM helps architects are  Improved communication  BIM allows every information related to the design of the building to be shared across all concerned parties. This means that all the architects on the team can instantly refer to the latest designs. This helps eliminate confusion and improves collaboration. Better visualization - BIM enables architects to see the buildings in basic 3D dimensions (height, width, and depth) along with 4D dimension (time to complete each element) and 5D dimension (cost at each stage). These detailed visualization tools help speed up the process from design to construction. Higher quality - Due to proper documentation and calculation of important designs, there are higher-quality designs and construction processes. BIM allows construction managers to view where every element needs to go. This keeps the building activity operating at peak efficiency. Preconstruction simulations - BIM allows architects to visualize and plan the entire project during preconstruction. They can use space-use simulations and visualizations to analyze the space beforehand and make changes to the design before starting construction. Having a greater overview minimizes expensive changes later. Improved coordination - BIM significantly improves the coordination between subcontractors. It also helps avoid clashes with automated clash detection. This reduces the amount of rework needed. Using BIM, one can avoid unforeseen issues by enabling easy reviewing. Better scheduling - BIM helps reduce the time of project cycles by eliminating construction schedule setbacks. It helps schedules to be planned with better accuracy. This along with improved coordination can help complete projects on time and save costs. Simpler building maintenance - BIM enables observing the anticipated operational costs for a building once it's complete. This can help make better decisions to improve cost savings and thus, ensure simpler building maintenance in the future. BIM is an invaluable tool for architects. In fact, its probably fair to say that those architects utilizing BIM have a greater chance of creating good designs while saving costs and improving process efficiency.

Integration implies the process of creating a whole from the sum of its parts. In construction, this spans the gamut of activities from collaborative working practices to how data from unique sources can be brought together for greater efficiency and effectiveness. For contractors, bringing data about project plans together with cost and quantities is tricky enough, particularly in a profession subject to the unexpected in terms of weather extremes, economic shocks, and planning challenges. Helping clients to see ahead and plan their myriad imagine a scenario in which prospects effectively has always been important. Thanks to BIM, integrating such information into a construction-ready model is now possible. In fact, it is often the starting plan framework.This is apparent to construction companies in the USA, including even the small and mid-sized companies in the space. The goal of better designed, more sustainable, and lower cost digital buildings is praiseworthy. Yet, the expertise challenge this creates can be tough to overcome for small and medium construction companies in centers away from Silicon Valley and similar locations. These companies are looking at working with partners to get their BIM initiatives off the ground. Of course, this is a model the software development industry has made popular. The way it works in that scenario is; the software development partner has the skills, the processes, and the ability to scale up or ramp down teams in accordance with the needs of the client. Of course, this is also a great option for construction companies looking to leverage the power of BIM. However, before embarking on this path, its useful to know what could go wrong. That knowledge can help prevent your BIM initiative stalling when it encounters similar headwinds. Here are 5 things that can go wrong while working with a BIM partner: 1.  Poor communication: A large number of construction companies that have adopted BIM technology face a peculiar issue in creating an efficient communication channel between the various construction departments working simultaneously on the project. This becomes a key challenge with BIM-driven projects due to the transparency. There is no hiding place  no covering of late information and mistakes. Of course, this is a bigger challenge when the BIM model is coming from a partner, usually located at a remote location. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a method of project communication that ensures a smooth flow of communication between the BIM provider and the various on-site teams. Seasoned BIM service providers are attuned to such collaborative working. They should help create an impactful communication model to support successful project outcomes needs to be implemented by the management 2.  Lack of end to end experience: BIM can impact various aspects of the construction project. It can deliver value in the planning, resource estimation, project management, ongoing monitoring, and, even, ongoing maintenance post-construction. That apart, the data the BIM model can help generate has tremendous value in itself. Clearly, when utilized to the fullest, BIM can help construction projects save significant amounts of time, money, and effort. But that kind of upside is possible only when the BIM partner has the end-to-end expertise to deliver across the entire project lifecycle. Without that experience, the BIM initiative could deliver sub-optimal impact, or, worse, no impact at all. 3.  Lack of experience in large projects: Gauging the experience of your BIM partner is the most significant step while finalizing the deal. Ask yourself  Does your BIM partner have experience in complex projects? What makes the BIM partner stand apart? How many projects have they worked on? A BIM service provider with that experience will bring greater depth and breadth of expertise. A BIM partner with global experience will bring the best to the table in terms of construction practices, techniques, tools, and technology. A partner without that breadth of expertise will probably fall short when faced with the real-world challenges of construction projects. 4.  Lack of ability to scale: Do your construction projects go through a smooth and linear growth? Probably not, right? Its likely that the initial planning stage needs many more resources of a certain type. Once the design is done, those resources can scale back and a different set of resources need to take over. But theres always the unexpected to plan for. Suppose your project needs a major change in the design you would need to quickly ramp up the resources for a short period of time. Working with a BIM partner can be a challenge if the partner cannot scale up or ramp back teams in sync with your needs. Projects are typically on tight deadlines, so that scaling needs to be quick and responsive. A BIM partner with the ability to scale can accelerate your project delivery and one without that ability can seriously hinder it. 5.  Lack of understanding of the American Construction Industry: A key challenge in implementing and executing BIM with a partner is the partners understanding of the American Construction Industry. The BIM partner needs to stay abreast of the latest developments in construction materials & methods. The partner must have the latest updates about changing government rules & regulations on both state and central levels. A failure to bake that information into the model can have its own downside in terms of lost time. Every construction project involves a steep investment of cash and human resources. BIM can help you deliver projects more efficiently and effectively but its vital to zeroing in on a BIM partner who is the right fit for your organization. Such a partner can help you make the most of the power of BIM for your construction projects.

It sometimes seems that the entire world has come to a standstill. However, despite the reigning uncertainties, the lockdowns across India are slowly getting lifted and economic activity is gradually beginning. While the crisis still looms, it also gives us the chance to turn it into an opportunity. The Government of India, under the direction of the honorable Prime Minister, has laid an impetus on infrastructure and technology-driven systems, as a part of Indias future strategy to come out of this crisis. It is abundantly clear that building infrastructure will be crucial to develop and accelerate the economy. The highway construction sector is already seeing tremendous focus and there seem to be major plans to commence work on a war footing on highway projects. However, we also need to bear in mind that the world of work that we will enter post-lockdown will be very different from the world of work that was. For starters, it is highly unlikely that social distancing is going away anytime soon. But with fewer resources available, on-site social distancing becoming the new normal, and fewer people available to address each task, how can we make sure productivity meets economic needs? To emerge out of this situation we have to ensure that we enter the post lockdown stage with speed, agility, and optimal resource utilization. When it comes to complex infrastructure projects like the highways construction sector, technologies such as BIM are going to act as force multipliers to assist us in navigating the challenging environment that is to come. Here is how technology will act as a great enabler of the construction industry in the post COVID world. Maximize resource utilization BIM, or Building Information Modelling, is more than your average technology product that merely provides a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. It is also a shared knowledge resource that helps in driving reliable decisions.BIM gives construction projects the ability to effectively map and manage the resources needed for a particular task. In the new world with reduced budgets, time constraints, and fewer people, highway construction has to make sure that resource allocation is optimized on-site. In this world, construction companies will have to turn to technologies such as BIM to grow their pool of off-site experts to address the planning, resourcing, design, analytics, collaboration, tracking and monitoring, and other key functions and make sure that work can be conducted more efficiently using less labour. Facilitate better planning Infrastructure projects are infamous for extending beyond the designated timelines. Given that now we shall be racing against the clock, we need to remove all the obstacles that impede timely project completion. For this, quite naturally, project management teams and all stakeholders have to get complete and transparent insights into project progress and project impediments. We also have to look at procuring and using more modern building materials, make accurate time and cost estimate projections, and ensure that all changes to the original plan are made and recorded as decided. With BIM, construction companies can connect all the stakeholders including the architects, contractors, designers, and developers. It can help them visualize the whole construction series and understand the progress of construction activities proactively throughout the lifetime of the project. This helps in identifying the gaps, if any, between expected and actual project completion time. It optimizes equipment, material, and human resource planning and eliminates waste. Improved site logistics management accelerates the construction process and reduces delays in materials procurement. It also enhances coordination capacities and productivity and thereby leads to cost and time savings as well. Smooth information exchange Information in the construction industry is very asset-heavy. Yet, it must move with agility across teams and stakeholders. Time loss owing to incomplete information sharing or loss of information during the exchange process can lead to significant project delays. Gaps in information between teams can cause clashes. Clashes mean rework and delays. And each delay has a cost impact. Technologies such as BIM accelerate project progress by enabling transparent collaboration and complete project monitoring during the project execution phase. Report of the actual project status, delays, and potential catch-up plans are all detailed out and ensure proactive risk mitigation. Better communication between different teams and divisions, visual communication of project parameters and ongoing progress, and proactive identification of sequencing or phasing issues help drive better-aligned efforts. Forecast successes and challenges As we progress through a project, the variables tend to change as well. Timelines can get updated, material procurement might get delayed, the design could changewhen it comes to construction, nothing can be set in stone (or concrete) given the vast number of stakeholders, departments, and teams involved. The construction industry will have to become more agile to accommodate these changes easily so that project timelines can be met and financial losses capped. Instead of relying on guesswork and having to deal with sudden changes, using BIM as a dynamic modelling tool can solve these problems. BIM can be a powerful tool and can be used to diligently forecast both positive and negative scenarios and help stakeholders gain deep insights into understanding and predicting potential clashes that impact project progress. Post-construction evaluation Moving ahead, we also have to learn from our mistakes. When it comes to the construction industry, information usually resides in silos. It does not flow freely and it definitely cannot be accessed easily. However, as we come out of the COIVD crisis we have to make sure that our efficiency, especially for crucial infrastructure construction projects, increases dramatically. But can we achieve this as well using BIM? All the information regarding the project from the start to end, all variables, all data, every piece of project-related information can be stored in BIM models. BIM thus acts as an information repository that can be accessed to identify what went right and what did not after project completion. Using these insights gleaned from data future project planning can be further fine-tuned and all the impediments to project success can be dealt with. In Conclusion The government of India now plans to construct more thandouble the highwaysconstructed in the last fiscal. There is also the ambitious highway development program -- Bharatmala Pariyojana --which includes the development of about 65,000 km of national highways. States are already mobilizing the supply chain and addressing transporters' concerns to re-start highway construction projects. While we cannot deny the existence of the crisis, there is something that we can do about it. Focus on infrastructure development, is a great direction to take as an effort to rebuild the economy. Building the infrastructure will result in more job creation, increase economic activity, and create demand.An infrastructure focus will also help us make up for all this lost time. All we need to do now is to make sure that we make the right technology choices to tide over the challenges in the post-lockdown world of work and make sure that all these projects get completed in time.

Heres why! BIM can fuel USAs growth story in the construction sector. Heres why! The construction industry is one of the largest sectors in the world economy, yet its challenges are gaping. The sector is labor-intensive and has processes deeply set in the physical realm. Low efficiency, delayed construction and high costs are a few aspects that offer opportunities for optimisation. Digital transformation is the lever that can catapult this sector into its next wave of growth. This is whereBuilding-Information Modelling(BIM)comes into the picture. BIM offers the potential to view the entire project in full glory, covering all elements of design and construction, right at the pre-construction stage. Access to information at every phase has deeprepercussionson the time taken for completion and overall costs incurred. Real-time information on the project fosters deep collaboration between stakeholders, helps them foresee risks, and reduces the possibility of errors. Implementation of BIM is possible at different stages covering eight dimensions, which translates to information for all stakeholders at various depths. The case for a BIM mandate in USA With expenditures reaching over 1,293 billion US dollars, the United States is one of the largest construction markets worldwide. Post the pandemic-led pause, the sector is expected to bounce back with anticipated growth in the healthcare, commercial, and transportation sectors starting in 2021. The demand for housing is on a steady rise, with multi-family complex, residential projects picking up pace. Managing this increase in workload with no significant drop in productivity would need the right technologies. Quite evidently, BIM can offer solutions for many of these incumbent challenges. Construction firms in the USA had started implementing BIM in the 1970s yet the adoption rate has been rather slow. Even at a projected growth rate of 15.6% in 2021, the sector doesnt yet have a national-level BIM mandate. In 2003, the US General Services Administration created the National 3D-4D-BIM Program that included a BIM adoption mandate for public building projects. Among the states, Wisconsin was the first to implement a BIM mandate for public construction projects for over a USD 5 million budget or more. BIM mandate in the US has been challenging because there is no single federal agency that can plan and mandate BIM for all public projects. Without a mandate, BIM adoption is likely to be slower as it will be dependent on the association between construction firms, contractors, architects and other stakeholders. For BIM adoption to grow, we must think of BIM beyond its use as a design tool and explore the depths of information that BIM models provide. The information at every stage of construction enables enhanced control over the entire project, reduced errors and risks, optimized costs, better safety and logistics and faster completion. Besides, BIM can be used in diverse construction arenas including highway and road engineering, rail and metro transportation engineering, landscape and land development, tunneling and subway architecture, offshore and marine architecture, heritage building conservation to name a few. Even if a universal mandate is not feasible, a gradual implementation would work in the nations favour with federal buildings leading the way for BIM implementation. The government should refine the mandate based on its own experience with BIM. Besides, a mandate governing construction projects in the private sector may also be worthwhile, especially based on the building height, size or complexity or environmental impact. The regular revisions of the National BIM Standard-United States (NBIMS-US) will propel the adoption of BIM as a comprehensive tool for visualization, construction simulation, and facility management for any project. While mandate implementation may take its time in the US, having defined BIM standards can facilitate faster adoption. Adoption of BIM across the globe With the increasing demand for urban planning and smart cities, many countries are moving faster towards BIM adoption. The Scandinavian countries Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark have been among the early adopters of BIM. In 2007, Finland implemented IFC compliance and BIM adoption for all public construction projects. Similarly, Norway adopted the BIM mandate for its state projects in 2010, followed by Denmark in 2011 and Sweden in 2015. In 2016, Norway shared an open BIM certification. The Swedish Standards Institute has published a series of guides with the aim of promoting BIM in the country since 1991, while starting from 2014 the BIM Alliance Sweden has brought together the main public and private stakeholders, to find more resources and support construction innovation. UK has also been a forerunner when it comes to BIM adoption. In 2011, the UK government aimed at digital transformation of the construction industry that would eventually project UK as the leader in the sector. Thus in 2016, the UK implemented a BIM Level 2 mandate for all its public construction projects. While Portugal and Spain are already going strong on BIM, France and Germany have scheduled a phased-out introduction of BIM in the last couple of years. In Asia, Singapore was one of the first countries to adopt BIM, followed by Japan, Korea and China. In 2015, the Building and Construction Authority in Singapore had made BIM obligatory for all construction projects over 5,000 square metres. Since then, the Singapore government has witnessed a significant increase in construction productivity. In fact, the government estimates that productivity increases by up to 30% when using BIM. Australian state governments see similar benefits and some have introduced similar mandates. These leading countries share a common goal: digitizing the construction industry to help minimize costs and ensure sustainability. A strong BIM mandate is helping them achieve this goal and build a smart nation. Shouldnt USA be then acing BIM too? What do you think?

This plan included $200 billion of federal spending over the next decade and this would spur about $1.3 trillion in overall spending tied to the various infrastructure projects from cities, states, and private firms. Theres no doubt about the opportunities the sector has to offer. Its also true that the USA leads the world when it comes to construction. This is a massive industry. But why are so many headlines dominated by news of delayed projects, missed deadlines, penalties, and poor financial performance? One of the reasons is the sector lags others in the adoption of technology. Software-driven solutions exist for streamlining planning, operations, project management, and maintenance. But adoption is lower than optimal. BIM, a key technology used in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry is a great example. The software is a proven enabler of better planning, collaboration, monitoring, resource estimation, and maintenance support. Some other leading construction markets have made the use of BIM mandatory for public infrastructure projects. Consulting powerhouse PwC estimates that theUK has seen savings of over 400 million Poundsper year since their BIM mandate. But qualified BIM resources are hard to find. Those that are available are expensive. This is an even bigger problem for small construction companies or companies located away from the traditional tech hotspots. This is where working with BIM partners is rising up the popularity charts. Like the software sector, companies have often felt that the chief reason to work with a BIM partner was to leverage the cost advantage. But there are some other solid reasons why working with BIM partners makes sense: Hub of talented professionals As we mentioned, finding talented BIM professionals is a major obstacle for companies looking to kick off BIM for their projects Managment. This problem is easily solved by hiring a BIM partner. There is no need for the construction company to find, train or retain people. The partner brings the right skills to the table. They ensure that their experts are updated with the latest developments in technologies and construction methods. What the construction company gets is a reliable source of expert BIM talent. The experience to learn from All construction projects are complex. But adding the layer of technology like BIM, inevitably, brings in a major variation. This may need changes in other areas like communication, review patterns, and workflows. A BIM partner with the right credentials can make it easier for construction companies to make that change. They dont need to reinvent the wheel. Instead, they can lean on the experience of the BIM partner who has been there, done that. The partner will communicate frequently and clearly and address any problems proactively. This will make it easier to increase the collaboration between the stakeholders. This could also, potentially, mitigate several other risks associated with the projects and reduce frustration and pitfalls in the long run. This enhances outcomes by improving efficiencies. Fast off the blocks By hiring BIM partner agencies, construction firms can get an instant injection of expert BIM talent. The BIM partner would usually have larger BIM-specialist teams in place that they would have built up over many years. They would have a reputation as a BIM expert. This gives them the advantage of being able to hire fast when needed. For the construction company this means that if theres a need to ramp up a team, this can be done right away. This is an important aspect for firms who want to get their projects started right away. Of course, the reverse also applies in that when the spike in work is done, the BIM partner can also scale back equally quickly. This ability to ramp up and scale back on-demand could become a massive competitive advantage for the construction company. Consistent quality The right BIM partner will have, both, breadth and depth of experience. Such partners would have worked on large, complex projects. They would have end-to-end experience of different types of construction projects. They would know the impact that BIM can deliver at each stage of such projects and what they have to do to deliver that impact. This will enable them to infuse those benefits into every stage of your projects too. Rather than the construction company having to learn on the fly, it can depend on high-quality BIM output from the very start. This will ensure consistency and quality across the entire project, irrespective of nature or scale.  Hire a BIM Partner for Maximum ROI The AEC, MEP, and construction industry is undergoing several changes and innovations. The companies that embrace this change are likely to stand out and make an impact. Working with an expert partner can make it easier for construction companies to adopt the challenging new technologies that can deliver transformative impact. Its either that or stay rooted in the old ways and watch the construction world pass them while riding the technology wave  3 Ways to Avoid Construction Delays in India An Easy To Follow BIM Adoption Roadmap  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

The concept of digital and spatial representation of buildings has also been around more than that. Over this time, lots of variation and perversion has occurred to the term BIM. BIM IN ITSELF ISA REVOLUTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. Building information modeling (BIM) is the procedure of generating and managing building data for the entire lifecycle of a facility. The three-dimensional, real-time, dynamic building modeling software used in BIM can decrease the wastage of time and resources in the process of designing and constructing a structure. BIM providesvirtual information model that can be handed over from the design team to the contractor and subcontractors and then to the owner and it benefits the overall project schedule. BIM helps build a project virtually prior to the construction starts and it is known as virtual construction. First of all, virtual construction is not a synonym for building information modeling and they should not be used interchangeably. Virtual construction technologies can deliver projects ahead of schedule and within the budget. It is helpful for planning, coordination, and communication on civil infrastructure, and commercial and heavy industrial building construction projects. It is sure that if a project is designed and constructed in a collaborative environment using BIM, it can really save time and costs on site. Earlier, the speed of communication was inhibited due to limited forms of media. Fast communication, obviously often seeks to transfer risk from one member to another of the team, instead of addressing it head-on. As3D Modelingimproves site coordination, this risk is dramatically eliminated altogether. BIM can compile all project information in a universally understandable way. When the clarity and speed are improved, it will automatically reduce estimating time, which will result in higher quality. Objectives of various BIM stages Constructability analysis: With virtual construction and BIM modeling Coordination of Building Components: with clash detection and virtual coordination Extraction of quantities: with BIM model components Construction sequence simulation: By connecting the construction schedule with model components The benefits of 3D models by BIM are several. The data contained in each element in the model may appear to be just one small piece. But it is very necessary to complete the larger puzzle of the construction project. Moreover, everybody involved in the project can easily understand the exact quantities and quality of the entire project. That means, the team members do not have to sift through pages upon pages of drawings for several weeks to extract information. It will happen in a few moments. Difference between Building information modeling BIM and virtual construction: As per experts BIM is implemented under the entire project life cycle from Planning, Designing, Construction, and Operation but specifically under Architectural Building project types. On the contrary, VDC (Virtual Design & Construction) is implemented under the designing and construction phase under different project types from the architectural building, urban development, infrastructure development, etc. In short, BIM covers all phases of a building life cycle horizontally. Even though virtual construction covers just two phases, it reaches multiple markets and project types vertically.

But not anymore. BIMs popularity has increased exponentially across the world and the US is not behind in this league. More and more architects, engineers, and contractors are looking at BIM beyond its 3D modeling capability. BIM for construction is being considered as a collaborative tool that impacts the entire construction lifecycle. In the past decade, stakeholders in the US construction industry have realised these top 5 benefits of BIM adoption and implementation: Seamless communication among project stakeholders Efficient project management Time, cost, and resource savings Use of prefabrication and modular construction Improved site safety Here are a few examples from the US construction industry that clearly demonstrate the benefits of BIM application beyond the 3D model. Seamless communication among project stakeholders Boarding Area B of Harvey Milk Terminal 1, San Francisco is a great example of improved communication and team collaboration with the help of BIM. This project involved a virtual design team from different geographic locations including New York, New Delhi, Melbourne, and Dubai. The cloud platform of BIM ensured collaborative project discussions and coordination of design changes and other project alterations were accommodated within the project timelines. For a geographically diverse team working on a large-scale project, this streamlined information exchange made sure all stakeholders had the same project vision and thus avoiding discrepancies and delays in deliverables. Efficient project management Project management through BIM is reflected in the construction of the Super Bowl LII Stadium in Minneapolis. This project incorporated over 500 unique models from designers, architects, and engineers. Through BIM, all construction stakeholders were involved in design, documentation, and workflow management. Besides, modeling and animation of major construction components helped stakeholders foresee possible risks. This efficient project management mitigated budget overruns due to delays. In fact, the project was completed six weeks ahead of the scheduled completion date.  Use of prefabrication and modular construction When it comes to the use of prefabrication with the help of BIM, the McHenry Row redevelopment project in Baltimore serves as a good example. In this project, the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems for the wall panels were identified through BIM modeling. The wall panels were fabricated off-site with pre-cut openings for the pipes, ducts, and electrical work. These panels were later transported to the construction site. BIM for construction along with prefabrication increased efficiency and avoided possibilities of hard clashes during this project. Improved site safety Apart from planning and designing, BIM as technology also helps mitigate on-site injuries and accidents. For example, with the help of BIM modeling, pre-manufactured, shared racksystems for plumbing, heating, and cooling were built for a large hospital project. These were built on the ground and later transported to the job site, thus requiring fewer labourers on ladders. The pre-manufactured units saved time and also reduced injuries of labourers or other construction hazards. Time, cost, and resource savings One of the largest community college districts in the US, the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) had procured funding for enhancing the campus facilities. Launched as BuildLACCD, this massive project used BIM for construction and remodeling campus buildings. The collaborative 3D process ensured real-time information management and better conflict resolution. This, in turn, reduced rework and saved time resulting in $12 million cost savings and 12% labor savings.                                                           Such applications of BIM reflect the change in outlook for planning, designing, and construction and BIM mandates in the construction industry could add momentum to BIM adoption in the USA and the world.

Is BIM Adoption Waning? Ever since Building Information Management (BIM) concepts emerged in the 1970s, Governments and construction companies around the world started to adopt it. What started as a technology exclusively used in large sites and developed countries got extended to developing countries too. It has now become a standard in the construction industry. In fact, over the last few years, construction companies in India started to adopt BIM to reduce construction delays and cost overruns. Even Government bodies like the Maha-Metro Corporation decided touse BIMon the Nagpur Metro Rail project to build an integrated environment where data such as project schedule and cost is easily available for managing. However, despite the proven benefits, not as many companies as should be are enthusiastic about adopting BIM. Lets try to understand the reasons behind it. Is BIM Adoption Waning? Although companies recognize the role of BIM, the ground reality is more complex. While we are wholehearted supporters of BIM, we recognize that to evangelize the technology we must understand the obstacles and perception gaps impeding growth. Here are some reasons why companies are being so slow inadopting BIM. 1.Lack of enthusiasm in adoption In a2019 NBS survey, lack of demand was cited as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of BIM. Small companies may not consider BIM as a priority. They think there is no compulsion to use it and companies do not consider it to be significant to project completion. Paul Morrell, the UK Governments Chief Construction Advisor, blames it on lack of data. Heres what he had tosay. Its (BIM) sort of stalled because I think people are thinking wheres the data? If we want companies to prioritize BIM, we need to ensure that there is enough data to prove its benefits. But as Morrell says, unless companies use BIM, we are never going to generate the data to prove its worth. Its a kind of catch 22 situation for the industry. The fact is,if you seek the data, you will find it! 2.Lack of talent and training Construction companies face a tough challenge inrecruitingskilled people. The primary reason for it is the conventional image attached to the industry. Millennials prefer flexibility and choose companies that are more obviously linked to a technology future. Considering that millennials will form 75% of the industry by the next decade, there will be a mismatch between their expectations and their perception of the way the AEC industry works. Our industry is considered to be inflexible; the office spaces are also not as glamorous as the IT industries. The industry is also perceived to be male-dominated, so gender diversity is low too. Another challenge is that companies arent known to prioritize training. The lack of talent, training, and contextual awareness creates a challenge for companies to adopt BIM. But even experts likeMcKinsey are confident that a transformationis coming and sitting this one out isnt an option. Construction companies will have to make significantchanges in how they workand in some fundamental processes. This will be essential to keep up and deliver to the expectations of digital employees and customers. 3.Cost vs. benefits With margins in the construction business being so tight, companies are unwilling to invest in new technology without being assured of the cost benefits of BIM. There are direct costs such as investment in hardware, software licensing, training of professionals, and maintenance involved. Even leaving aside the ability to implement the technology and leverage it properly, the big challenge is to get the construction teams to adopt the BIM output onsite. So, companies are hesitant to invest. Of course, they fail to recognize the benefits the technology offers to the company, designers and engineers, and consultants. And while on-site adoption is a real issue, its not an unsolvable problemas we have shown. 4.Lack of defined scope and unrealistic expectations Companies often do not have a defined scope for BIM implementation. They are unclear as to what objects they want to get modeled in a particular project phase? At what level should they be modeled, or what information is needed to complete a BIM use? To add to the woes, they often do not have the right partner to guide them. Some partners tend to overpromise and set unrealistic expectations, which could be hard to attain. Others tend to deliver projects and walk away without offering any help to the company to indulge their own digital ambitions. For long-term sustainability, companies must have a well-defined scope for implementing BIM and partners who align their goals with the clients needs and expectations. Any less, and BIM ends up an experiment or a transaction restricted to one project. Conclusion Although we have seen some remarkable improvement in the adoption of BIM in countries like India, the full potential of this wonderful technology is still untapped. A country like India has a vast talent pool and access to BIM, which can be utilized to scale the projects and attain an attractive cost to benefit ratio. There is a fertile opportunity for the industry to utilizeBIMto transform itself. This needs the willingness to change the way work is done, hire new people who understand technology and make technology a significant part of the overall strategy. Its time to take the first step, because as Morrell said, Once you can see the benefits of working in this way, why would you do it in any other way?

If the estimation is not correct on a project, it will affect the business negatively. While underestimation of the cost leads to loss of money, the overestimation may result in failure at the bidding phase. Even though the direct victim of this issue in traditionally fixed-price contracts is a contractor, the impact of poor estimation will be seen in the entire project. The typical pain areas for BoQs industry-wide are: As quantity take-off from2D draftingis not connected to the resulting BOQ dynamically, the surveying team has to take many days in order to visualize the construction of 2D drafting. Even though BOQ industry needs the cost and resource-loaded schedule. It is not in the hierarchical structure of the BOQ. There are different methods to estimate cost codes and schedule resources at various levels of detail. BOQ or the schedule is not the structure for cost controlling and cost capture. But a third structure should be mapped to these two for cost controlling and cost capture. ESTIMATING PROCESS A baseline of the cost required at the various stages of project development is called cost estimation. The cost engineer or estimator predicts an amount at a given stage, based on the data available. Even though several types of cost estimation methods exist, Bill of Quantities (BOQ) Unit costs are the most commonly used. In this approach, the bill of quantities assigns a unit cost to each of the components or tasks. If you sum the quantities that are multiplied by the corresponding unit costs, you will get the total cost of the project. The unit cost method is based on a simple arithmetical principle and is very accurate in estimating. But the proper application is essential. However, there are three key factors that decide the success of this method. The first and most important factor is that BOQ should be accurate There should be a well-defined framework for the construction procedure, which is commonly called asStandard Method of Measurement(SMM) orWork Breakdown Structure(WBS). The framework should contain a series of tasks with the allocation of quantities to those tasks. Estimating tools are the third factor. They are used to calculate cost accurately based on WBS and BOQ and report the expecting estimates in client-defined formats. Besides the three main factors, there are many other fixed or variable factors like inflation, consumption rates, taxes, currency fluctuations, contingencies, etc., which should be considered by the estimator. GENERATING ACCURATE BIM QUANTITY TAKEOFF: The best way to get an accurate BOQ is nothing but the adoption ofBuilding Information Modeling services. The possibilities of common errors in BOQs are minimal in the projects that useBIM processes and technology. BIM represents a single and accurate design model instead of providing several drawings. A BIM model can create abim quantity takeoff automatically, which means it has the inbuilt intelligence to know about each building element and what it is made of. Therefore, if any change occurred in the design of a model, the BOQ will also be updated. EXAMPLE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING SERVICES QUANTITYCOMPARISON: Costing is one of the most important aspects of a project to the owners of the project. Controlling cost escalation and managing material is one issue that cannot be compromised. Quantities for architectural and structural components are extracted at the schematic, tender, Good-For-Construction (GFC), and construction stage. At the schematic stage, it is used for budgeting. While tender, the BIM quantities are compared against the tender costs. As the design is refined at the GFC stage, the revised quantities are used for evaluating change requests. On completion of execution, thebim quantity take-offsfrom the model are used for bill verification. At every stage, the accuracy of BIM quantities exceeds the accuracy of conventional thumb rule calculation. Overall adoption of building information Modeling services helps control cost escalation and disputes during the checking process. On average, while comparing the benefit of BIM for Accurate Quantification and material procurement it can be summarized through our project experiences that Time is taken to calculatequantity from BIM-1 day Time is taken to calculatequantity by site team-1 week The difference in thequantitiesis anywherebetween 1%  8%. BIM SOLUTIONS APPLICATION AND BENEFITS TO STAKEHOLDERS: The availability of software packages that can help prepare bills of quantities is increasing day to day. Bills of quantities are produced with the help of building information Modeling services. They do this task using the information contained in the model. Thebenefits of integrated BIM solutionsare several and they are beneficial for everybody in the construction industry including owners, cost consultants, project managers, and contractors. Building Information Modeling serviceshelp owners take a hands-on approach to managing investors, stakeholders, and contractors. Using this technology, the project managers and architects can provide their services on behalf of their clients. Cost consultants can provide various services like rapid and credible cost planning, energy analysis and procurement services, etc. BIM helps contractors support revaluation amendments.  6 Outcomes of BIM Modeling services achieved through changing project design Sonali Dhopte speaks on BIM adoption in smart cities at construction world  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

The construction sector has become less shy of adopting mobility as well as modern tech such as ERP andBIMto improve processes, streamline projects, and make building construction sustainable. These modern tools are bringing together stakeholders belonging to the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sub-fields and improving planning, estimation, collaboration, and tracking/monitoring. The construction industry is evolving without a doubt. But the rise of technology has a hidden entry barrier. When it comes to the ability of construction companies to attract and hire technology talent, the construction industry pales in comparison to the Silicon Valley giants or tech startups along the east and the west coasts. Hiring tech talent has always been a rocky road for construction companies but its high time the old-world perception of the construction industry changes. In this article, lets have a look at what makes hiring tech talent harder for construction companies and what exactly they can do about it. Why is it harder for construction companies to hire tech talent:  Competition with other tech players When we talk about tech talent, either fresh out of college or seasoned and experienced, the first image that strikes our mind is a millennial working in a modern, glamorous office space, enjoying work flexibility in terms of hours and physical presence. When a construction company sets out to hire tech talent, they are basically competing with a sea of startups and companies from established tech centers. Beating these well-branded companies that have heavily urbanized tech centers and culture for innovation, to find and retain the best tech that would be interested in working for construction tech is not a cakewalk for sure. To add to the challenge, as the pandemic has driven more and more tech companies open themselves up to location-independent remote talent, even the people from the smaller towns who used to look for jobs in construction have become hard to hire.  Lack of flexibility Millennials are the largest segment of the workforce in the USA and in the next decade, themillennials will form around 75% of the global workforce. For them, it is necessary to have a culture that accommodates flexibility- be it with flexible working hours, telecommuting, or fully-remote working. The construction companies do not fit in the traditional image of being flexible, something which is gradually becoming non-negotiable for the modern employees.   Lack of gender diversity The construction sector overall is known for its rugged image that is perceived to be male-dominated if not entirely male-only. The civil/construction engineering branches have more male students than females and the trend seeps across even when it comes to hiring IT talent. This simply slashes the number of potential candidates available for hire. For millennials and Gen Z, workplace diversity is critical, in fact, around83% said it is something they look out for when choosing their employer. Moreover, having a diverse tech team that employs women along with a background in tech can usher in the much-needed innovation in the construction industry.  Lack of innovation Although now actively using modern tech, the construction sector has been pretty old-fashioned when it comes to fostering innovation. In fact, many of the elemental innovations or ideas that can redefine the impact of construction come from people with a non-construction background. For example, Elon Musk was the first one to propose the construction of underground roadways and the development of a heavy-duty, highly sophisticated tunnel-boring machine to combat LA traffic, an idea that was barely considered by the construction companies across the countries, Innovation and development programs to drive career growth are key factors that determine the employee experience, especially for a modern workforce. The reluctance of construction companies to innovate, embrace modern tech, and reform its organizational culture overall is one of the major reasons why tech talent shies away from joining a construction company. What the construction companies can do about it:  For attracting the talent To begin with, glamourizing the construction sector and changing the prevailing dusty image of the construction companies is essential in attracting tech talent. This includes infrastructural as well as cultural changes- more modern office spaces, visible technology adoption, workplace diversity, and flexibility are all important. With COVID-19 creating the need for remote working, construction companies are also opening up to the concept of the same, and hence hiring no longer needs to be geo-specific. Construction companies can now affirm that employees can be equally productive when working from home provided they are provided with the right tech to connect and collaborate remotely. Embracing automation, reducing the dependency on manual work, and using modern productivity and collaboration tools to streamline remote working can further help in attracting tech talent. Incentivizing performance, offering learning opportunities, and creating lucrative performance-based pay packages at par with non-construction companies can be monumental in attracting tech talent.  Retaining the talent Talent retention is as important as talent acquisition, especially for construction companies where tech talent is hard to find. Modern employees today want to associate with organizations that foster employee development through innovative programs, opportunities for upskilling, and learning. Construction companies need to bring in a cultural change to retain employees- through mentorship programs, team activities and acknowledging workplace diversity- for women as well as underrepresented communities. Purpose has never been more important -to the growth of the company as well as to the employees. Emphasizing tech-driven initiatives will of course be critical. Looking in the pool of talented individuals, companies have to fight hard to land the best of the lot. Construction companies in particular need to stay ahead of the game when hiring tech talent and these pointers could help them get the people who could help them become more effective and impactful.

The industries that heavily depended on the frontline workforce to operate were stalled. As the curve seems to flatten, these operations are slowly reopening across the United States and are a beacon of hope to drive normalcy, employment, and economic progress. COVID-19 and the construction industry The construction industry is a major economic driver,employing over 11 million peoplein the US. The construction industry is trying to breathe life into projects that were abandoned sometime around February 2020. While the regular projects were paused, the pandemic also brought in new opportunities for the rapid construction of testing facilities, quarantining centers, and locations for medical screening. Construction companies who were assigned a mammoth of a task to finish these projects in a very short span, of course, turned to modern tech such asBIM- Building Information Modeling. Construction companies that were earlier hesitant to embrace BIM were exposed to its benefits that can help in recovering from COVID-19s impact on the construction business. Several modifications to the traditional mode of operation of the construction activity are expected and it will be challenging for construction companies across the United States to bounce back. Lets have a look at the 5 changes coming up as construction activity picks up. 1. Managing the cash crunch As per asurvey by PwC, 71% of participants belonging to the engineering and construction sector expressed financial concern as the biggest impact of COVID-19. Needless to say, cash flow will be one of the major constraints for construction companies. As per areport by the World Economic Forum, the construction sector in the USA hasnt still leveraged technology to its fullest. To manage constrained finances now is the time to make use of the power of technologies like BIM. BIM can help in accurately estimating material demands to ensure you dont lock unnecessary funds in wasted materials. Further, BIM can help you in planning your labor resources and optimize costs. 2. Addressing the construction material shortage While we are discussing the issue of raw materials, we have to account for the possible shortage of the same. The USA imports around30% of its total raw materialrequired for construction from China, with some companies fetching around 80% of their requirement from those shores. Following the shutdown of Chinese manufacturing units, there has been a shortage of material. The current complicated trade scenario isnt likely to allow an easing up of those supply chains soon.With BIM, companies can estimate their raw material requirement better, make judicious usage, and plan ahead for orders and be ready whenever the supply chains open up as usual. 3. Providing a safe working environment and revision of labor contracts Workplace operations have drastically changed. There are new rules for managing employees to ensure social distancing. Emergency protocols were already in place a few weeks before the outbreak but post the re-opening, there will be severe implications. Without the complete opening of public transports, lifting of travel bans, and opening up of schools and other child-care facilities, workers might not be able to return to work immediately in full force. And even if they do, they have to be rostered in shifts which means that resource planning will become critical. Companies have to focus on accomplishing the same (or better) results with fewer employees in the near future. This calls for a revision in labor plans as well as enhanced resource optimization using Building Information Modeling for timely project completion. Using BIMs fundamentalbenefit of clash detection, companies can ensure improved work efficiency with minimum rework, better staff utilization, and lowered costs. Off-site experts andremote working partnerscan be of great help. 4. Data-driven decision making for prioritizing projects Construction companies have to balance between completing the pending projects while controlling their cash outflow. Construction projects require strict adherence to schedules for completion often incurring financial penalties for delays.BIM can be valuable in planning and scheduling workflowsto optimize delivery times while making the use of available resources to their full potential. The use of Building Information Modeling can aid in overall project delivery planning with efficient communication, collaboration, and constant monitoring of the projects progress. This could be a crucial help in making up for a lost time. But it is important to note that adopting any tech, especially on a large scale is challenging. This calls for expertise and may require changes to established processes and workflows. Seeking the help of a trusted domain expert who can partner in the adoption is hence recommended for getting the required ROI. 5. Preference for green buildings and construction The construction sector is infamous for contributing to the global climate crisis, being responsible for around 40% of the total CO2 emissions. The post-pandemic world will be more conscious about the choices it makes- be it for food, fashion, or energy consumption. The construction industry has already been seeing a rising demand for driving more energy-efficient projects, creating less waste, and opting for green or eco-friendly construction materials. Using BIM, construction companies can take important steps in implementing the same phase-wise, with optimum resource planning. By participating in the Green construction movement and creating zero-emission buildings, the construction sector can gain financialgreen stimulus packageshelping in economic recovery while giving back to the environment.

And sure enough, organizations are reaping the benefits from massive digital transformation initiatives underway currently. The construction sector has also seen growing interest in the potential of new technology innovations to disrupt the sector. The construction industry is fragmented and traditional. Construction industry investments in technology often trail what companies in other industries spend on technology. Automation in construction technology can lead to several benefits for the construction industry. Some research suggests that as much as49% of construction taskscould be automated. Be it worker safety or faster completion of work itself, construction technology may have a huge role to play in delivering safer and better construction environments. Adopting construction technology is today a necessity rather than a choice for construction companies looking to stay relevant and competitive. Many companies have started to take note of the edge that can come from adopting innovative technology for construction. Here are some ways where construction technology can be a game-changer for the industry, delivering better outcomes, and driving transformational growth: Improving productivity with software One area where construction companies struggle commonly is how to constantly ensure that the productivity levels keep improving. With construction technology, this can be addressed. Using mobile apps and cloud technology can foster new levels of collaboration between workers and project managers. Cloud-based software solutions and mobile apps enable on-site workers to update progress, submit time cards, expense reports, ask for information on the go, without wasting too much time in manual paperwork. Using cloud technology helps in streamlining routine work and in turn improving the overall productivity of the team. Analytics for better decision making With technology, the construction industry can now closely track and monitor the progress of their construction projects with all the relevant data at their disposal. Data-focused solutions not only help in capturing critical business data but also uncover the hidden patterns, which companies can leverage to predict future outcomes and take timely decisions accordingly. Predictive insights can help construction companies identify potential problem areas and be ready with the solutions, rather than act at the last hour. Connected technology like sensors can be used to track material inventory on the site for greater control and visibility and to reduce downtime by ensuring timely replenishments. Drones and high definition cameras can help to capture data on everyday progress and compare with the schedule and BIM models to track the deviations and address them in time. Analytics-based tracking helps in enhancing transparency and building more accountability into the system. Augmenting worker safety A very critical aspect of the construction industry is to ensure the safety of its labor workforce. This is critically important given that1 in 5 workplace fatalitiesin the USA occurs on construction sites. Dealing with heavy machinery and laborious processes delivered at risk-prone locations creates a more dangerous work environment. Especially emerging tech like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality can be implemented at construction sites that will give workers a better idea of what is involved and train them better to achieve the desired output. Safety checklist and use of wearable technology can help in mitigating the risks faced by the construction workers. For example, using sensors at certain important areas can alert workers of any threat to their safety, which helps them act in time and make the right decision on the site. Or a project manager can simply use VR tools to exchange information on on-site progress. The use of drones is also a growing trend in the construction industry to provide more comprehensive visual information about the site for better safety. Leveraging BIM technology with other technology Building Information Modelingor BIM is no longer new. BIM offers a collaborative platform to all the stakeholders involved in delivering a construction project. This 3D design software works as a real-time tool where all the concerned people can collaborate and communicate based on a shared model. This creates an organized effort and eliminates clashes at the design stage itself. The sheer detail of the BIM model holds forth great promise when tied into other emerging technologies. For instance, immersive VR technology along with BIM provides a great scope for real-time visual collaboration and learning. BIM can also play a powerful enabling role inoffsite construction,modular construction, and3-D printing. Efficientproject planning BIM can also be tied synergistically to software solutions like construction ERP solutions and Project Management solutions for a continuous impact on the project. Using BIM tools, integrating AI and ML tech enables construction companies to get deep insights into the project. Companies can plan their project better  in terms of manpower, in terms of inventory, in terms of budgeting and estimation, in terms of execution and safety. Using technology to aid projects results in more sustainable construction as companies not only save precious man-hours spent in doing repetitive tasks but with better planning of resources companies can also control expenditure and eliminate safety hazards. All in all, technology makes way for an efficient and productive project plan. Construction companies are slowly but surely understanding how technology can make a huge impact in their way of working. Many companies have already moved ahead with their technology investments and are already seeing benefits. Technology in the construction space is advancing every day and adopting emerging tech will help companies retain their competitive edge. Whether its team collaboration, worker safety, sharing critical information, or tracking project progress, technology can help in all areas to deliver a transformation in the construction landscape.

This has an impact on project completion timelines, project profitability, and even sustainability. AEC contractors specifically, and the construction industry in general, have chosen to adopt BIM to address these major challenges. The utilization of BIM in the AEC industry is on the upswing as architects, contractors, and engineers are adopting Building Information Modeling (BIM) in their projects. BIM is finding favour with them as it is an extremely practical and productive approach towards project design, development, and project management. BIM offers engineers and architects a platform to better design and deliver structures based on standards and other environmental restrictions. BIM provides not only better data but also effective quality as the segments and workflows are fully digitized. Effective inculcation of BIM enables an organization to set up an improved collaboration among the engineers, contractors, architects, and site-managers. An effective BIM consulting strategy empowers these organizations to integrate data-rich models and project databases to construct a virtual portrayal of the project before they build it and to then keep it updated as the project progresses. BIM provides all the team members easy access to all the data, making collaboration simpler, reducing dangers and improving profits. Theres no longer any doubt that this technological advancement has deeply impacted structural design and project execution in the construction industry. In that context, lets zoom in on how AEC consultants, contractors, and companies work with BIM? How can the use of BIM benefit AEC companies? Architects and designers are utilizing Building Information Modeling to control structure construction, project planning, and sequencing. BIM empowers them to generate multiple design alternatives and check the constructability of the structure for each of them. AEC BIM consultants can design better project plans before going on to the site. BIM also helps extensively over the course of the project delivery by improving collaboration, proactive clash detection, and transparent ongoing tracking and monitoring. The AEC industry utilizes BIM for the following: 3D visualization, clash identification, practicality analysis, constructability review, quantity and cost estimate, environmental analysis, and data for facility management. Improved construction and development efficiency, Enhanced collaborative efforts and data sharing among the team members, Reducing on-site risks and danger throughout the project, Promoting efficiency by minimizing errors or mistake between designers and engineers, Ensuring accuracy and reliability. It is well known that AEC projects are susceptible to various negative influences. The construction environment is extremely dynamic and there are multiple players simultaneously working on the site. It is also true that poor coordination is commonplace in such an environment due to inconsistent sharing of information, outdated data, and differing priorities. Issues such as loss of data during data transformation, errors in workflow integration, and lack of coordinated efforts are the norm. To prevent such issues, AEC companies are adopting BIM. This allows the AEC company to: Update info:With BIM, the team members get better control over the project information they have to work on. The BIM model gets updated as the project evolves. This ensures that any changes made in the structure are captured. The differences between plans and ground-reality are eliminated allowing for better-informed plans and decisions. Use information throughout the lifecycle of a project:BIM empowers the project members to access all the available data throughout the various stages of the project. This is especially useful as the project keeps developing and ongoing decisions need to be made. Avoid coordination errors:BIM helps with better workflow integration. With BIM, it is easy to establish a common language for the processes. Clashes are visible early and to everyone in the system. This reduces all the possible coordination errors in a project. That, in turn, reduces rework. Utilize best-of-breed solutions:BIM provides a sound, consistent, data foundation that enables project managers to use diverse programming tools for various applications. With BIM, an AEC organization can choose tools depending upon the requirements of a project secure in the knowledge that the tool will deliver the desired impact based on comprehensive, current, and accurate data about the construction site. BIM can deliver real value to the process of design and construction of projects. This is why a large number of AEC organizations are adopting this innovative technology to expand the delivery of their projects. Even as construction continues to stay challenging, SEC companies are on the frontlines of trying to bring about tech-driven change. The adoption of BIM technology is enabling more AEC organizations to address key concerns of efficiency and effectiveness.  Why you need construction sequencing management?

India's construction industry contributes the most to Indias economy, just behind agriculture. It's also the second-largest in terms of employment and provides thousands of jobs around the country. According to estimates provided by the government, the construction industry has grown by 80% over the past 4 years and has gone from generating $78 billion in 2013, to around $140 billion in 2017. Explosive growth is great, but growth should also come to greater social consciousness. And sure enough, an aspect that is getting ever-more attention is the safety of construction workers and safe practices on construction sites. It is, unfortunately, true that each year, many workers die on construction sites, either due to falls, electrical mishaps, or accidents at the workplace. The labor Ministry figures (reported by NDTV) show that 450 workers were killed and 212 injured on site in 2013. Between 2013 and 2016, the numbers almost doubled, to 1,092 deaths and 377 workers injured. A sector thats as relevant and promising as real estate must include better safety regulations. We believe that technology and innovation can solve many problems, and Building Information Modelling (BIM), in particular, has a lot of potentials to solve many problems. Let's take a look at how BIM can help improve construction safety. Focus on innovation in safety When it comes to construction, the most effective forms of safety programming occur during the planning and preconstruction phases of a project. Till recently, pre-construction safety improvement techniques, such as designing for safety (DfS) have faced many issues which are caused due to design flaws. What BIM does is that it allows the opportunity to detect and predict hazards from an early stage. It's a collaborative effort because our designers need to be aligned with all the other project stakeholders to identify, isolate, and fix the hazards and risks early. Leveraging data to improve safety at the pre-construction level BIM can effectively make use of data to improve safety at various stages. Risk analysis and safety evaluations that would previously only be carried out at the site can now be automated, thanks to BIM. Designers are able to identify hazards way before they come into play. The design-driven storage and indexing of documents and certificates make referencing a lot easier. This allows designers to plan out their safety measures with greater precision and in accordance with all the regulations and compliance mandates. Visualisation and prediction One of the very cool applications of BIM is that it allows you to configure the digital information so that one can preview a range of potential (what-if) scenarios. Consider how useful it would be to do this with reference to health, safety, and hazards. Designers are able to play out all kinds of scenarios so that when it's time to construct, everything is in place and one is well prepared. Advantages of BIM on-site The superior material-planning abilities of BIM allows us to fully utilize the prefabrication of materials off-site, in a highly safe and controlled way. It also facilitates automated compliance checking, which means that one can swiftly check if everything is up to mark in terms of regulations with little effort. Scenario-planning once again comes into play, where BIM becomes the fundamental blueprint for the contractor on-site. Training workers in safety Most construction workers in India are from low-income backgrounds and are mostly uneducated. This means that there is sometimes a language barrier when it comes to communicating rules, regulations, and best practices. BIM's ability to communicate information visually and in an interactive manner can be leveraged to visually showcase critical elements, plans, and developing situations. This helps ensure that the workers get a better training experience and are better prepared for any kind of scenario. Reduction of rework Since BIM has a holistic approach, it factors in everything, from electrical plans to plumbing and everything else. This means that there is greater synergy between teams and very few clashes between tasks. Fewer clashes mean less rework and also a reduction in accidents that may occur when people onsite try to find on the fly solutions to address such clashes. The role of advanced tech within the BIM framework BIM also mixes well with futuristic technology such as simulation, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Not only do these help provide a better user experience, but they also help to visualize forthcoming challenges better and to plan better to reduce the risks on site. It is said that during the design of the empire state building in New York, the design team infamously allowed for 'one death per floor' in the report for the project. During the construction, only seven people lost their lives which was actually viewed as a good thing. In an age where technology can be used to enhance almost every aspect of our life, it is time that we use it for the betterment of all, including the staff on the construction site. The real estate industry is beginning to embrace modern technology to make the process of construction more efficient, faster, and resource-conscious. We suggest that technology should also play a role in improving construction safety.  Can BIM be the core of your Green Building strategy?

In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, governors across American states have issued shelter at home orders. People are being advised to stay at home and only people performing essential services are advised to be out. While some states, likeMassachusetts, have exempted an array of construction activities from the provisions of the lockdown, its not business as usual for even those construction companies. Companies are facing delays on many projects as social distancing norms and employees staying away are impacting the available human resources on site. In addition, supply chains are also being impacted by lockdowns and travel restrictions. At this stage, companies are worried about how to get these projects back on track even as parts of the economy open up. As has been said, every crisis hides an opportunity. This crisis too has opened up the minds of construction companies to explore ways to innovate and accept technology as a way to propel their projects forward when the time comes. Even as projects are stalled or progressing slowly, construction companies are taking the time to look for ways to make better schedules, correct designs, align the efforts of teams, and plan for resources and material requirements better. Theyre looking to create a situation that will allow them to hit the ground running when a semblance of normalcy returns. And theyre looking towards technology likeBuilding Information Modelingto do so. Turning to technology like BIM at this time can prove fruitful for the construction industry. BIM allows easy collaboration and sharing of data in real-time among team members and provides easy access to up-to-date project information at all times, anywhere. The collection of data about on-going, but stalled, projects in BIM makes it easier to create better plans. This enables accurate decision-making that could positively impact the rest of the project lifecycle when work restarts. By incorporating integrated BIM, the carried over design clashes and constructability issues can be resolved, thereby averting costly rework or compromises as construction resumes. How can BIM help to contribute towards saving time? The contractors are looking for innovative alternatives to reduce the embedded delays that inevitably creep into the project lifecycle. The building project managers are taking advantage of the lull to focus more on the preconstruction stages of the lifecycle, such as planning and designing during this quarantine phase. BIM can help designers to identify gaps and improve the design so that inefficiencies can be identified and removed to save time. BIM can help to encourage working and design collaboration between design consultants, engineers, and architects, along with streamlined and coordinated communication. This can help identify (and predict) possible problems in constructability or in converting the architected design into a functioning structure. This will allow the company to design well-considered workarounds for mitigation. As construction picks up again, these solutions will help reduce or eliminate the impact of the problems to save effort. Of course, with BIM, designers can create a comprehensive 3D model of the structure. It is well known that this allows for the detection of potential clashes that could emerge during the construction phase. Detecting these clashes early can help each team prepare their response and work better to avoid on-the-fly rework and improvisations. These take time. Better plans help to save that time and improve productivity. This will, in turn, help to speed up the process of project development. There are other inherent advantages of BIM that can positively impact acceleration of schedules as work picks up. For one, consider the ordering of materials.BIM modelsgive a very accurate picture of what materials will be needed when and in exactly what quantity. This means the materials can be provisioned for use at exactly the right time for maximum efficiency. Another advantage of working with the BIM model is the collaboration due to the arrangement and updating of all documents in a single location. This single frame of reference ensures that everyone is working from the same source, preventing communication gaps and delays. COVID-19 is testing the resilience of the American construction industry. But theres always a new day. And when that new day dawns, technology solutions likeBIM can contribute to the efforts of the construction companiesthat want to make up for a lost time.

In the USA in particular, it has been implemented in various key construction projects withWisconsin being the first state to mandate the use of BIMon public projects. This was back in 2009 and within 10 years, many more firms are using the technology to achieve exceptional breakthroughs in the architecture, construction, and engineering niche. That being said, theres a talent challengefor the small and mid-sized construction companies. Its hard for them to hire, retain, and motive BIM resources. This is a strange situation for them. They know that their projects will do better with BIM. But they cant leverage that power because they dont have the inhouse skills. Partners are an option. But truth be told. Its an uphill task to find and engage a potential BIM partner, who can do a great job irrespective of the scope of the project. To make that choice easier, here are some questions such firms can ask their prospective BIM partner: Do you have a presence in the USA? While different countries have implemented BIM, the way how it works from region to region can vary to a great extent. One of the core obstacles in executing BIM in the USA-based projects with a partner is the latters know-how of the construction practices in the country. For instance, they should know about the latest trends and developments in terms of materials, design methods, rules, and regulations, etc. Likewise, it is also important that the BIM partner is located in the same country as this helps co-ordinate better for certain projects. There needs to be effective communication between all the stakeholders be it the clients, the in-house departments, and anyone who is directly or indirectly involved in the projects. This allows more room for transparency and instant responses. And when you along with the BIM partner work in the same time zone, there will be no room for agile decision-making. With a remotely located partner, the communication may not be as smooth. Therefore, hiring a BIM partner with a responsible presence close by will save you a lot of stress down the line. Do you have end-to-end experience? More often than not, it is important to find out whether the potential BIM partner has relevant experience in the specific areas that you require help in. BIM can play a role in the design, construction monitoring, renovation and refurbishment, and ongoing facilities management. And how BIM plays a role in each area could be different in subtle as well as profound ways. To get a better perspective, you can ask your prospective BIM partner for their detailed portfolio and understand the core areas in which they have hands-on experience. This will help you assess their skills such as  are they only restricted in carrying out the planning phase best or can also take up the maintenance, design, and post-construction challenges? These questions are essential as a BIM partner with end-to-end experience will help get results across the entire project lifecycle. What makes you stand apart? No one wants to work with run-of-the-mill or superficial BIM partners, who will have nothing much to bring to the table. One of the ways to assess this is to check the firms relevant experience and skills in the niche, find out about all the projects they have handled so far, take into consideration the complexity of the projects and the standard practices they follow. Partners with experience of large projects will bring a level of expertise and experience that will help you grow your own skills as well. If this is in-sync with your requirements, go ahead with them. Can you scale up/down? Rarely do construction projects have a smooth growth phase. They may need scaling up or down from construction phase to the construction phase and on a case-to-case basis too. For example, some projects require a more elaborate initial planning stage while others need more collaboration efforts. Either way, your firm may need more resources or expertise for a while and then may have to scale back. This is where you need a BIM partner who can take care of the scaling and handle any change in the initial plan in an agile fashion. It should be possible for them to ramp up and scale back without compromising on the quality of the resources. With this capability, they will be able to deliver the results within the stipulated timeframes responsively. Do you implement strict quality control measures? No one can neglect the quality aspect of the construction and development projects. Issues left unattended today can have massive implications later. And the plans and models that are made with BIM can have an impact on this area too. Some BIM service providerswithout the richness of experience dont necessarily implement the required quality control in their projects. Scratch below the surface to understand their quality focus. Ask them for details of their reviews, approvals, and rework processes. Talk to some of their senior folks to understand their viewpoints. Off to work These are some of the essential questions that will pave the way to helping you select the best BIM partner. Since it is an important decision that will affect your future projects, make sure that you do your research even before proceeding to contact them. The key is to select a partner who can embrace the ever-changing industry with a futuristic mindset. The aim is to implement tomorrows technology today and to keep moving forward!  5 things that can go wrong while working with a BIM partner How mid-size US construction companies can ride the technology wave  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

Theres an increase in awareness about how 3D BIM models enable better collaboration, enhanced visualization, better asset planning, and effective time and cost management for new construction and renovation/ upgradation projects alike. However, after any project completion, the primary concern is the operation and maintenance of the building and its in-built assets. This makes asset management a crucial practice in the construction industry. Asset management is the administration of daily operation, maintenance, and repair of each asset in a building. In the construction industry, we may perceive BIM and asset management as independent practices. Yet they have a direct correlation. The synergy between the two can help with streamlined maintenance and reduced financial costs. Let us look at how BIM can support asset management.  Role of BIM in asset management BIM offers structured information management for all phases of the construction lifecycle. Its shared model can collate data around planning, designing, installation, commissioning, and related aspects of an asset. Upon project completion, the digital handover of BIM information models to asset management systems can empower asset owners with information about asset performance, maintenance, and safety. Advantages of integrating BIM and asset management When BIM and asset management databases are linked, information management becomes seamless.BIM renders itself for the creation of the digital twin of the physical asset thus, making asset location simpler. It also provides accurate real-time information across asset categories. In addition, BIM acts as an information storehouse for asset data that includes asset history, its operation, its size, dependencies, and disaster recovery. This easily accessible asset data supports better planning of maintenance, repair, and replacement and reduced time in asset maintenance. For instance, a problem in an AC duct can be easily identified through the BIM model. This can help the maintenance staff fix the problem in a few hours or in a single visit rather than what may have taken longer with traditional asset management. The 3D model can help identify point and linear assets in the building structure. The asset data also provides information about interconnected point assets and linear assets. For example, point assets such as faucet, basin, sprinkler linked with the linear assets such as water supply, drainage pipes, and others. Challenges of asset management without BIM Without BIM, there will be no structured data for asset management. Asset data from the construction phase cannot be extracted. This also hampers the identification and location of hidden assets. For example, BIM is not integrated with asset management for a construction project. If a false ceiling is constructed later, asset owners and facility managers will find it difficult to identify the electrical cables and pipe routes without digital asset data. In such cases where no asset data is available, the false ceiling will have to be broken for any repair work, thus adding to the maintenance cost and time. Integration of asset management with BIM: An example from Excelize portfolio We, at Excelize, have witnessed asset management integration through BIM in multiple projects. The construction of SIDRA - super specialty hospital in Qatar is one such example. It is a 600-bed hospital for women and children built on a plot area of 77 acres and a built-up area of 430,000 square meters. Integration of BIM and asset management is useful in projects like hospitals where asset maintenance needs to be well-planned to avoid hindrances in surgeries and medical treatments. For example, shutting the hospital power supply to service one hospital room or equipment can affect the functioning of other rooms. However, the integration of BIM and asset management has made it possible to identify the hospital areas or, rooms that will be affected if the power supply is cut off during repair and maintenance. To maximize the potential of BIM, we need to use it in the post-construction phase when the asset is handed over to the owners. BIMs support in asset management not only ensures improved building management but also optimum utilization of time and costs. Let us look at BIM beyond the design and construction phases.  BIM can fuel USAs growth story in the construction sector. Heres why!

Delay or deviation from the set construction time and budget only add to the project risks. In fact, delay is one of the most recurring problems in the construction industry across the world and India is no exception. These delays have a domino effect on the project completion time, cost, and quality. Construction delays are a liability to all stakeholders involved and lead to clashes and sometimes abandonment of the project. Time overruns, especially in infrastructure projects not only increase the completion time of ongoing projects but also hamper the commencement of new projects. These delayed projects consume more economic resources, reduce infrastructure accessibility to the citizens, and slow down national development. All these aspects have a crumbling effect on the economy. There are two main types of delays that affect the construction industry: excusable delays and non-excusable delays. Excusable delays are unexpected and often beyond the contractors control such as access to the site restricted, labour protests, or unexpected weather conditions. Non-excusable delays are delays due to project aspects that can be controlled and avoided by the contractors such as performance, inadequate project planning, quality issues, or delayed procurement. While excusable delays like weather conditions are beyond control, the Indian construction industry can work on reducing non-excusable delays. Here are three ways that could help stakeholders mitigate non-excusable delays: 1. Adopting the right technology As mentioned earlier,construction projectsare influenced by internal and external factors. There are multiple stakeholders involved in each construction phase. Delays are often caused due to misaligned project teams, lack of standardized systems and processes, and inefficient communication between stakeholders. This is why digitization is the need of the hour in theconstruction industry.Adopting digital technologytools enable real-time information accessibility, helps foresee and avoid potential risks and delays and streamline communication among the stakeholders. Similarly, using construction equipment that is aided by technology tools helps faster and accurate construction, better productivity and enhanced project planning and reduction in material wastages. Delhi Mumbai Expressway project is an example of how digital technology aids better productivity. Using Digital Controlled Machine Graders (DCM) up to 300-350 cum per day of soil was moved and graded as against 100-120 cum per day without DCM, which is anincrease in productivity by around 200%. The 24x7 operation further increased the production per day by 50% and at the same time, the contractor could reduce the actual team size required at the site. 2. Implementing bonuses and penalties Another way to avoid construction delays is by applying bonuses and penalties on construction projects. Early completion should be incentivized with bonuses whereas project extension and late completion should be levied penalties. There are a few examples of India adopting early completion incentivization. In 2017, the Indian government had considered offering a 10% bonus of total project cost for early completion of highway projects through the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the National Highways Industrial Development Corporation (NHIDCL). In 2019, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal announced that railways will be offering incentives to contractors for the early completion of construction projects. These preset conditions of bonuses and/or penalties can bring in greater discipline for timely project completion. 3. Review the bidding pattern For public procurements, the Indian government employs one of the three bid evaluation criteria: Quality cum Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)- Theres equal weightage on the technical qualifications of the bidder and the cost committed by the bidder. Quality-Based Selection (QBS)- Here the evaluation is based on the technical qualification of the bidder. Least Cost Method (LCM)- Here the evaluation is based on the cost committed by the bidder. Currently, LCM or the L1 is the most commonly used method for bidder selection. The NITI Aayog paper has reported that the current L1 method leads to non-performance, suboptimal delivery, increased cost and delays throughout the lifecycle of public construction projects. In this view, the paper has mentioned ways to rethink the bid evaluation process to ensure high-standard quality and performance for critical infrastructure projects. One way could be by increasing the adoption of the QCBS method for state-of-the-art projects where quality is uncompromisable. The paper also suggested implementing a performance rating system for contractors to ensure quality control. An effective bid evaluation will help achieve the best infrastructure and also boost Indian construction firms to raise their standards for global competition. To conclude, contractors can do their best to avoid non-excusable delays by adopting digital technologies for effective procurement, planning, and project delivery. On the other hand, the clients and government authorities can use bonuses and penalties as tools to achieve the estimated completion time. Lastly, a revaluation of the current bidding system for public procurement can raise the bar of quality and performance, reduce delays and achieve timely construction of state-of-the-art assets.

That has enabled them to ramp up their construction, use resources intelligently, and ensure safety and sustainability.The benefits of BIM adoptionare well-known. Even across the USA, companies have made projects more cost-effective, timely, and sustainable by adopting BIM. Construction companies and contractors have found that using BIM has also helped them prepare better project bids that help them win more orders. However, many companies are facing a tough timeimplementing BIMbecause they lack access to the people with the right knowledge of implementing BIM strategy. This is risky considering that BIM adoption can cost the construction company time and money. So, what can companies do to make BIM adoption easy? The first step would be to create a BIM adoption roadmap to guide companies in their implementation process. How To Create A BIM Adoption Roadmap? Understandthe value of BIM Investing in BIM is expensive, considering that companies need to invest in software, technology infrastructure, and people with specialized skills. Hence, it is prudent to understand its significance first. One way to determine its value is to develop a pilot use case. For example, use it to optimize the design for a smaller, contained project and see how it delivers values. This will enable the companies to determine how they can optimize the usage of BIM on a wider scale. Digitize processes To ensure full value from the BIM adoption, companies must digitize a range of their processes. BIM can help drive agile decision-making. It can help teams collaborate better and communicate more meaningfully. It can promote transparency in reporting. All this needs a change of organizational processes to deliver maximum impact. Digitizing processes will help the construction company create the enabling infrastructure to make the most of BIMs considerable power. Establish data-sharing standards BIM can be adopted only when data on design, costs, and schedules exists. However, inconsistent data sets can pose a challenge in generating insights and in the seamless adoption of BIM. Hence, companies must establish data-sharing standards and agree upon uniform conventions, especially if the construction is happening in different areas. This will reduce confusion and miscommunication between various stakeholders and improve efficiency. Promote collaboration between different stakeholders Construction activity is largely fragmented. Most teams are concerned with their scope of work, ignoring the larger impact that could have on other teams. To ensure the seamless implementation of BIM, all stakeholders must identify ways to collaborate continuously. BIM offers the opportunity to create a single-source-of-truth that can become the common ground to ensure that all the respective stakeholders are working in collaboration. Set a formal mechanism to improve collaboration. Take theUK Governments Construction Industry Council(CIC) BIM Protocol, for example. It is a standardized supplementary legal agreement for common construction contracts. The protocol demands that all the stakeholders obligations and limitations are clearly mentioned and shows the point of contact for managing all the data that BIM incorporates at each stage of the project. Keep the communication ongoing Communication is crucial forsuccessful BIM adoption. Reviveprocesses to drive ongoing communication between all the stakeholders. Leverage connected technologies to provide anytime, anywhere access to information for all the stakeholders, so they can communicate in real-time and accelerate the speed of BIM adoption. Ensure every stakeholder understands BIM Understanding the scope of BIM is vital for its successful adoption. Lack of BIM skills can slow down the process. Ensure that all stakeholders understand BIM and its implications well as it is the core of the digitized construction future. Upskilling the existing stakeholders through hands-on training is one way to make sure that everyone possesses the necessary skills. Of course, this is easier said than done. You could engage an experiencedBIM consultantorganization to make this process happen smoothly. Such a partner would drive the initial projects on the power of their own experience. As that happens, you get the opportunity to learn from them. If the partner has a local presence, they can help you refine your own processes and handhold you as you feel your way into the transformed BIM landscape. This could carry on for as long as is necessary for you to get your own BIM act in order. Be prepared for change BIM adoption goes beyond adopting the technology. It necessitates change management at an organizational level. The management will have to create a culture where employees understand the value of BIM and are willing to learn new skills to accelerate the process of implementation. Share information about how BIM will help them do their jobs better on an ongoing basis, so they are aware of its importance and more open to its adoption. BIM holds a lot of promise. But the solution is investment-intensive needing time, money, and effort to get right. Its not always possible for small and mid-sized American construction companies, especially those in the smaller centers, to hire technology resources to guide them. But BIM adoption requires guidance from real experts. Without that, a company risks running an expensive experiment. Thats where an experiencedBIM consultantcan help. A BIM consultant understands the needs of the construction company and advises on the ideal roadmap to follow. That could make a crucial difference to your BIM strategy.

But how do we make that work for us? BIM execution plans can be set up for a project or for an organization. A BIM Execution Plan (BEP) establishes the BIM implementation and adoption strategy, BIM goals, its workflow, information management between stakeholders, scope of the project, and many other aspects. This structured layout helps navigate through the BIM adoption process, mitigate information gaps, coordination issues, remote work-led challenges, and more. Thus, the plan plays a vital role in construction projects of any scale. In fact, larger construction projects with multiple stakeholders involved will see the greatest benefit from a well-laid out BEP. Heres a quick guide to the creation of a BIM Execution Plan and how it adds value to BIM implementation and the entire construction lifecycle.  Creating a BIM Execution Plan The process begins with assessing the clients BIM goals and capabilities and setting up a roadmap for BIM adoption. This is then translated into an abstracted BEP wherein clients mention their project requirements referred to as Employers Information Requirements (EIR). The BEP is, thereafter, framed outlining how BIM implementation will cater to the EIR. Once the basic goals, processes, tools, etc are defined, the specifics and finer contours of the BEP are sketched out. A BEP is a living document and receives inputs throughout the project lifecycle. Some of the items that are detailed out in the BEP are: Outlining the goals for BIM implementation for the project/organization Creating a detailed map on the various BIM processes such as 3D modeling, Clash detection, 2D extraction, 4D linking and simulation, etc at different project phases Defining information exchange between project members Stating roles and responsibilities of each project member Identifying the technology, the quality of information model, and the Level of Development (LOD) required for the project Mentioning the delivery strategy such as design-build or design-bid-build based on which project implementation takes place.  Benefits of the BIM Execution Plan The BIM Execution Plan reinforces benefits such as enhanced communication and collaboration, and effective time utilization. Here are some of the benefits that a good BEP sets you up for: The BIM Execution Plan enables better communication between team/project members. There is transparency in information received and ease of communication flow from the beginning to the completion of the project. Organizational silos and conflicts are minimized with a well-laid-out plan as each members role is defined from project inception. The plan could also include training to minimize risks due to wrong BIM implementation by untrained staff. Project members are better prepared for emergencies or unexpected delays as the BIM Execution Plan ensures information transparency at every project phase. This transparency helps save time due to project delays. Participants entering the project at a later stage benefit from the streamlined workflow set at the initial stage of the project. BIM is a highly collaborative tool for the construction industry. However, we need a BIM Execution Plan to leverage 100% of the potential BIM has. We would urge project owners or contractors to have a well-designed BEP for every stage of a construction project, regardless of the scale.

The infrastructure development taking place in the country drives this growth.All around us, India is experiencing major infrastructural advancements and transformative projects which will become key success drivers. And the aviation sector could be next in line for the infrastructure transformation. One of the challenges for the growth of the aviation sector has been providing connectivity to the smaller centres and improving the facilities in locations that have outgrown their current scale. And thats why modern airports are being planned across the country. We need modern technologies to fuel this airport boom and build the infrastructure of the future. Some of the best airports worldwide have used advanced innovations like BIM and it's the right time for India to adopt this best practice to realize the nation's vision in infrastructure development. For the benefit of the folks tasked with planning these airports and who happen to read this piece, a bit of explanation first.Building Information Modelling (BIM)is a multi-dimensional visual representation of the design beyond the traditional 2D representations. By baking in dimensions of time, project status, and cost, BIM has the ability to bring together various disciplines involved in the planning and design, execution, and maintenance phases of construction projects. BIM is, of course, highly useful for building a structure that involves critical design. But clearly, this definition is not needed. And thats what this post is all about. With a solid focus on innovation and a focus on advanced technology, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has mandated the use of BIM as the design and planning platform for the construction and development of airports. An airport includes various facility elements that must be constructed. The work includes civil, MEP, landscape, and interiors. Multiple areas need attention like the runway, control tower, and terminal buildings. The focus must be on utility as well as appearance. Hence the design is complex in nature. And the comprehensive model of BIM makes it come together beautifully. The integrated approach of BIM facilitates a better understanding of workflows and facilitates the creation of an effective timeline with negligible errors. And I say this based on our previous experience of having working on the BIM models for the Mumbai International Airport. Here are some great things I see emerging from this decision of the AAI. 1.The use of BIM will help enhance collaboration across the entire project from design, creation, and construction to operations and maintenance. BIM will centralize access to the data model and let the project team members at multiple sites leverage the data models regardless of their physical location. This will also let team members see each other's work and communicate with one another in real-time. BIM will help to better visualize the design for the air terminal for all those involved in the planning and construction. This will help them plan better for upcoming tasks and ensure that the appropriate resources are available in time. This should allow projects to get delivered on time. 2.Airports cost a lot of money to build. A massive amount of materials and resources are poured into that construction. And, its also true that a significant portion of that is wasted. Problems like over-ordering are common. Under-provisioning for key materials is also not unknown. This leads to having to order materials in smaller quantities, with urgent timelines which often costs more. Clearly, efficient estimations of the materials required can help save a pretty penny. And BIM can provide just that efficiency. 3.The use of BIM will minimize clashes between teams working on different areas like plumbing and electrical. This will help reduce rework and minimize errors. This should result in greater cost consistency, improve plan execution and design optimization. From being able to collaborate in the design, early planning, to construction and operations, BIM can brings together all the pieces of the puzzle. With thousands of people working on the site, communication at scale is important. It will enable everyone to review the master model, see each other's concerns; conflicting elements; inaccurate or missing structure components, and critical zones, both for coordination and installation. This will help save time as well as money. 4.BIM will help optimize the upcoming maintenance tasks of the facility by providing a reliable base structure to define management plans. This will make maintenance more proactive, sustained and comprehensive. This could help make airport operations more efficient and trouble-free once launched. This is of critical importance when you consider the sheer volume of moving parts that come together every day in even the smallest airport. This can also help make the ongoing airport operations more energy-efficient and, hence, more environmentally friendly. In fact, this focus on sustainability can be built in right at the design stage by focusing on integrating energy efficiency in the structure.  BIM, when implemented from the first stage makes it simpler to build, transform or reconstruct (a part of) an existing structure. The decision to utilize BIM will enable better plan and construction efficiency, reduce cost, and could also deliver a more positive impact on the environment. The creation of the nations air terminals with the added power of BIM could well set new benchmarks for various upcoming airport infrastructure projects everywhere.

But even as states open up and others designate construction as essential there are other problems looming. According to the AGC survey, the construction sector is hit by a labor shortage. As it becomes necessary to ensure that the workers follow social distancing norms, it may become harder to staff project completely. Then, there is also a significant disruption in the supply chain that could impact projects. In the face of such challenges, companies will have to think of ideas to compensate for the lost time and accelerate the speed of completing the projects. Construction companies would do well toturn to technologyfor help. But is there anything more they can do? Is there a solution out there that can add as a force multiplier for their efforts? Perhaps, yes. Companies can leverage remote teams for work that does not require an on-site presence on the construction sites to ensure accelerated completion of work. How Can Remote Teams Help In Accelerating Projects? Remote working in the construction industry might seem like an unlikely setup. But with communication, collaboration, and project management tools at the companys disposal, remote working has become a reality for construction companies. Here are a few things that construction companies can do to accelerate the completion of their projects while working with remote teams. 1. Adopt the tele-building concept Way before COVID-19 compelled construction companies to think of new ways to work, a company calledOpenSpaceused a photo-documentation solution to enable builders to walk through the construction site with a camera in hand. These photos are then uploaded and organized in a Google Street View type of a vista. That allows remote workers to view the construction site from anywhere. OpenSpace has also come up with a solution called tele-building, which is akin to telehealth where the inspectors, superintendents, and project managers can view the high-quality images of the site, thus reducing in-person visits and saving time and money for the company. 2. Leverage BIM BIM, as most know, is a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. It provides the designers, installers, and consultants with a comprehensive view of the project. It provides support with interoperability, flexibility, and customization, which can help companies to build better plans, organize the efforts of teams better, estimate material requirements more proactively, and drive more clearly aligned on-site delivery. This will help them save their time and lead to successful execution  an imperative in the current times. With BIM, companies can create comprehensive construction documentation, which can guide the designers, architects, and contractors to follow the sequences and ensure an error-free execution. And of course, theBIM modelscould be created by remote teams. For small and mid-sized construction companies, this is an even more significant benefit since they can access the top experts in the space without being constrained by location. In fact, this opens up promising collaborative avenues for such small and mid-sized construction companies. In areas like BIM, they can choose to ally with partners who have the expertise and experience to support them. This team can support the on-site construction remotely and amplify the overall impact. 3. Use next-gen technologies Rapid innovation is the order of the day, and technology is one enabler that can make it possible. Apart from BIM, construction companies must use next-gen technologies such as AR, VR, and Drones to stay ahead of the curve and to reduce the need for going onsite. Technologies such as AR and VR can help the offsite extended construction team to detect errors early on and resolve them before they become expensive mistakes. It also helps optimize the workforce as these technologies can create scaled virtual models of the site, which can be evaluated easily by the remote team. Drones can fly around to monitor and deliver supplies. Some construction companies are also considering using robots to automate basic tasks at the site. As is the norm today, these high-tech devices can be operated and controlled extremely effectively from offsite locations. 4. Comply with safety standards While a lot of work can be done remotely, workers will always be needed on the site. Companies have to ensure that these workers are safe and that they comply with the safety guidelines laid down by the government. Companies can provide project managers and directors with access to software that can provide them with data on safety procedures followed in the site and maintain safety remotely based on the data received. On-site information could be gathered by smart wearables using the latest Internet of Things (IoT) technology that enables these remote managers to access the most current information to enable better monitoring, tracking, and compliance. These are strange times. But that will not prevent companies from starting construction work again. Companies have to adjust to the new normal and find ways to complete the projects. Its now crucial to embrace digitization. But no one believes that this will be easy. We would recommend choosing collaboration tools that will help the architects, designers, engineers, and other important stakeholders to collaborate with each other while working remotely. Companies will also need to train employees to adapt to digital tools and learn to use them to their advantage. Considering that technology may well be the primary driver of productivity, bringing about a mindset change may become imperative to ensure the smooth functioning of routine tasks. Of course, this is hard to do without expert support. We, at Excelize Services, have been helping companies to embrace the power of BIM so that they can complete their projects on time in a cost-effective way. We offer a winning combination of onshore and offsite support to enable construction companies to adopt the best technology and kick off their own technology initiatives to achieve challenging business goals.  5 Changes In The Near Term As Construction Activity Picks Up Across The USA How Technology Can Help Construction Projects Make Up For Lost Time  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

From the way of living to the method of working  everything has moved to the so-called new normal. In this hard time, the construction industry has emerged with strategic intent and resilience but with a raft of new challenges to face. It is also true that the construction industry is facing a volatile time. Home construction is up but commercial construction and infrastructure investments are lower. Construction sites have shut down or are working with reduced staff. Supply chains have been disrupted. And various operational restrictions have been imposed. All this has dramatically pushed the construction industry towards embracing change. The future has never been as close as it seems today! Getting future-ready According to theMcKinsey Global Institutereport, economic activities will only return to 2019 levels by 2023 at the earliest. Construction companies are being forced to rethink business from the standpoint of being able to leverage technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. They need to anticipate the changes and make the necessary upgrades. Here are a few ways companies can get future-ready in the new normal. Powerful Technology Technology is one of the primary components of change in nearly every industry, but the construction industry has been guilty of avoiding technical advancements for a long. However, of late the future of construction technology seems to be brighter than it has been for a while. In the quest for safety, the construction industry is encouraging its employees to work remotely where possible. For example, engineers and designers are turning to digital tools like building information modeling (BIM), construction planning solutions, project management software, construction ERPs, etc. These solutions are allowing them to support on-site efforts and improve results. Contractors and engineers are using 4D or 5D simulations to reoptimize schedules and construction plans. Additionally, contractors are seeking customized tools to monitor their employees health, managing scarce resources, and reducing on-site work. Today, numerous future construction technology-based solutions are being developed to improve the efficiency of the industry. Construction companies are looking to build comprehensive technology adoption strategies that address several functional areas in an integrated and comprehensive manner for sustained impact. Investment in Prefabrication and Modular Projects The concept of prefabrication and modular construction has been popular for a few years now. These concepts deliver speed of delivery, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In a future that is likely to be resource as well as time-constrained, these are great benefits to aim for. Of course, the effective implementation of prefabrication and modular construction places greater demands on the planning, documentation, and data accuracy practices of construction companies. It becomes mandatory to set in place technology-based systems that provide accurate, current, and comprehensive data about the construction sites. Sustainable Construction The construction industry is inevitably moving towards more sustainable construction as a moral imperative. Given the enormous impact of construction on the environment, its critical to course correct now. That apart, sustainable construction practices are also sound financially because they help reduce waste, attract new customers, and improve resource utilization.  Sustainable construction is a very broad topic, and various layers are interlinked in it. There are the design and construction of green buildings in which products that have ecological benefits are used to construct a building. There is also the opportunity to leverage technology to plan construction activities better so the process of construction can also be more resource-efficient. Using advanced technologies like data analytics can also play a role here by helping construction companies derive insights from the data at their disposal to become more conscious. Shift in Jobs The nature of jobs could change due to the increased adoption of technology. With more technology integration, intelligent systems, and smart automation coming into the picture, job roles will morph. Construction companies will require people who can understand technology and deliver outcomes with new-age digital tools. They will have to change business and work processes and hiring practices to incorporate the impact of this technology revolution. Enhanced Safety Concerns Construction isnt the safest job in the world. The sector has an outsized share in workplace accidents and fatalities. This is not acceptable. In the future construction technology stack, technology to make sites safer will be prominent. Construction companies will have to adopt a strategic focus on worker safety. Process and practices will have to change. Technology can help here too as numerous apps, wearable devices, and other approaches come together to make a safe construction site for workers. Dynamic Project Management As construction becomes more complex, project management has to become more comprehensive and agile. Future projects will be delivered by multi-layered teams of specialists that interface with each other at specific points. Companies need to bake in various approaches based on which will benefit their projects before planning the strategy. Construction companies will need to invest in monitoring and tracking tools so that they can manage their project better. Platforms likeBIMwill become crucial as they provide a single pane of glass to enable a common understanding of the current stage and future scope of each project at all times. The construction industry has been evolving for some time now, but with the pandemic, the pace of change has intensified. In the future, new technologies, job trends, managerial strategies, and construction methods look set to keep evolving. Construction companies will need to invest in technology to stay relevant in the new normal. Creating a technology strategy and a roadmap could well be the crucial next step construction companies will have to take to ensure the future is secure.

Why you need construction sequencing management? Construction sequencing and scheduling requires you to plan construction activities while considering resources, spatial constraints, and other concerns. Scheduling and sequence analysis in construction guarantees that staging is streamlined and identifies potential conflicts. Construction sequencing usually requires scheduling and sequencing software to create, update, and communicate the project plan to the stakeholders through various reports. A range of representation techniques is utilized to envision the sequence and scheduling issues. The sequencing model ensures the smoothest possible construction sequence. In the context of construction, traditional methods used for project planning can't show how or why certain activities are connected in a given sequence. They fail to calculate precisely the critical way to complete a project as they cannot capture the spatial components identified with these activities. Sequencing and scheduling in construction is the process of listing activities and tasks with a planned start and finish date. Construction sequencing management becomes vital as the traditional planning methods fail to link directly to the building model. A construction sequence implies that the installation arrangement of project equipment and materials, as well as the grouping of units, frameworks or subsystems, depends on the plant sequence. The Construction Sequence creates methods based on engineering, designing, and operation activities. The importance of sequencing in construction projects cannot be underestimated since it plays a crucial role in the success of the project. As a practice, construction sequencing should be followed all through the project. It is also important that the written arrangement be modified before any changes in construction activities are executed. The plan can be updated if the construction site inspection indicates the requirement. Here's why sequencing management can have an impact. Effectiveness:Construction sequencing management is a useful tool for erosion control because it guarantees that management practices are introduced where necessary and when appropriate. The plan must be followed and updated if necessary, to amplify the effectiveness. Cost considerations:Construction sequencing management is a low-cost tool as it requires a limited amount of a contractor's time to provide a written arrangement for proper coordination of construction activities and practices. Application:Construction sequencing management should include the following:  Principal improvement activities.  Which measures should be introduced before other activities are started?  Compatibility with the general contract construction plan. For instance, construction sequencing can be utilized to design earthwork and erosion and sediment control (ESC) activities at construction sites where land disturbances might influence water quality. Construction sequencing management benefits the projects in the following ways:  It assigns dates to project activities.  Based on construction sequencing and scheduling, the preliminary expenses can be estimated.  It helps to identify whether the duration stipulated for the project is achievable or not.  It is also useful for formulating tender estimates for projects.  It helps coordinate the resources like materials, equipment, and labour with project work.  It provides a sequence of tasks. This helps to define the next activities that need to be prepared for.  It helps the construction team to achieve its goals within the time limit.  It helps focus on safety performance activities.  It helps to track actual work performed to determine whether construction is proceeding satisfactorily.  It helps eliminate problems due to production bottlenecks.  It provides comprehensive data concerning time, schedule, and resources.  It helps identify and resolve workspace clashes.  It helps maximize quality control measures.  It helps to achieve the highest level of productivity. Proper sequencing, 4D scheduling, and planning ensure the completion of the project on schedule and within budget. This not only defines the pace of the work but also provides an overview of how the tasks are executed. It identifies techniques and sequences in which materials are delivered. The construction sequencing management exposes details such as out-of-sequence work, scheduling clashes between multiple trades and various scenarios and phasing strategies. In the end, the aim is to deliver projects on time and within budget. Construction Sequencing Management helps construction companies achieve that goal.

The construction industry is one of the biggest sectors globally with an expected output of $12.7 trillion by 2022. As it happens, the sector is being hit by a new wave of technologies that could transform construction. Yet, the sector has been somewhat slow to adapt to technological advancements. And this shows in the results too. Unfortunately, the construction industry has gained just 1% productivity in the previous 20 years. Thats compared to over 3% for other major sectors in the economy. The low growth in productivity could be attributed to the inability to adapt to technology. Dont believe us? A McKinsey report on reinventing construction says, Productivity, or the total economic output per worker, has remained flat in construction. In comparison, productivity has grown by 1500 % in retail, manufacturing, and agriculture since 1945. One of the reasons for this is that construction is one of the most under-digitized industries in the world and is slow to adopt new technologies. So, why this reluctance to adopt technology? Some issues faced by the U.S. construction industry are:  Shortage of labor  Shortage of technology talent willing to work in construction  Archaic processes that hinder collaboration, reporting, and analysis Issues like these are making it hard for construction organizations to keep up with the technology wave. Here are three technology waves that will pass you by if you dont address these issues in your organization: Building Information Modeling (BIM) Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the way the construction industry executes projects. BIM is more than just3D modeling. The 7D BIM caters to both physical and functional aspects of a structure along with considering the cost and schedule of the project. It also helps in streamlining and collaborating information and making it available in real-time for all the involved parties. The easy accessibility of the data  the blueprint, design, 3D model of the structure, as-built; helps in saving valuable resources during construction and in the maintenance phase too. Companies are saving big, delivering on time, and building better projects with implementing BIM. Owing to this, many countries like UK, Germany, and Norway have mandated the use ofBIM for public infrastructure projects. Implementing BIM successfully depends upon the ability to understand and leverage the technology. It would help if you had experts to work on the software and to give you maximum impact. Thebenefits of BIMcould be lost to you if you are unable to build up a team of skilled professionals who are equipped with BIM knowledge. Automation and Robotics As the construction industry is slowly moving towards digitization, one cannot overlook the role of robotics and automation in this field. The U.S. construction industry reported over 200,000 unfulfilled construction job positions (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). Companies are focusing their attention on robotics and automation to try to reduce the dependence on human workers. Robotics and automation will help companies cut operational costs, increase efficiency in repetitive tasks, and improve output and productivity both on-site and off-site during a construction project. Of course, automation and robotics demand a sound data framework for the construction site with comprehensive, accurate, and current data about whats going on. Proactive planning becomes key. And many of these demand a stable and reliable model to function effectively. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Artificial intelligence is the term coined for machines that mimic intelligence and human cognitive functions. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to allow computers to learn from the data they are fed. Theres a humungous amount of data generated in a construction project, and the future success of such projects could depend upon the efficient utilization and execution of this data. Theres a vast potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence in the construction industry. Machines can act as smart assistants that can analyze and scrutinize the copious amount of data and alert project managers about issues that need immediate attention, thereby saving time on on-site changes. AI can help drive better planning by factoring in an array of conditions that are difficult to build in manually. Resource mobilization, estimates, schedule planning, etc. are other areas that AI can play a key role in. Of course, AI and ML demand data. Comprehensive data is essential to train the models for ever-greater accuracy. Without that, the models could fall flat in the real world. The construction industry has always sailed close to the wind. The overruns and rework during the construction phase have been robbing construction companies of their profits. But today, companies that are successfully adopting and implementing technological innovations are seeing improved productivity and profitability. Are you ready to adopt technology to improve your results too?

Construction companies are looking to clear the roadblocks for smoother and quicker implementation of projects. Digitization of processes to bring more efficiency at each phase of a projects construction, including upskilling the workforce with regular training are on the agenda of forward-looking companies.By leveraging advanced software, construction-centered solutions, and analytics, technology innovations are eliminating many of the issues that have been in the construction sector for quite a long time, including difficulties in compiling and sharing project data. There is a sense of inevitability about the arrival of disruptive thinking and a fresh approach that will change the way we train, work and eventually build, and develop in construction. The construction industry is at the start of a new period, with a growing appreciation of the latest applications and tools that could change how companies design, plan and execute projects. This reality suggests that the construction industry must become much better at taking advantage of the tech opportunities that emerge along the way. Only then, can the industry attract a young and tech-savvy workforce. Otherwise, the construction industry risks falling behind in the race for advancement. Many companies have started incorporating new innovative technologies. Technologies like AI, BIM, and advanced communications and collaboration solutions are seen as being able to drive a more agile and collaborative design effort and a more interactive design process where everyone involved can add their input and advance the virtual blueprint and have a critical contribution to constructions future. But how can small and mid-size construction companies in the USA go about embracing technology? 1.  Creating a functioning digital strategy: Organizations can take a reasoned and strategic approach to deal with the technology by building up a picture of their current performance pattern and benchmarking themselves to recognize the most critical areas for development.The organizations can consolidate an implementation plan that focuses on achieving key milestones in specific areas within a realistic timeline to remain on track as they keep moving forward.Organizations with strong digital skills have an advantage while implementing complex solutions across their organizations. But the first steps have to be small, manageable, and carefully considered. As the digital strategy starts kicking in across various sectors, more far-reaching and complex processes can be addressed. 2. Transforming the projects: A project is an opportunity for every organization to test and refine new digital solutions in a kind of splendid isolation. Pick a project that is reasonably self-contained and a good test case and start embracing point technology solutions within it. This is easier to roll out and easier to see results in. To monitor results, project teams can set up key performance markers and share them periodically with the leaders. This will help overcome communication gaps and generate enthusiasm. The project experience will also provide data that will prove useful to address crucial obstacles faced and help address large-scale programs efficiently. 3.  Letting data lead the way: A large number of the best development innovation tools incorporate data from both past and ongoing projects. Collecting, processing, and analyzing this data must become an ongoing and strategic exercise. As the practice becomes more widespread, organizations can incorporate analytics into their daily workflows by embedding insights into them. 4.  Getting the skills in place: Talent is a key challenge for mid-sized construction companies looking to ride the technology wave. In locations away from the tech centers and startup hubs, its hard for such companies to find, train, and retain the people with the right technology skills. Upskilling and training for the current employees are useful but only up to a point. To kick start the technology initiatives, its a good idea to work with an experienced and expert technology partner. This will give them access to not only the technical skills they need but also bring added flexibility in resource deployment as projects ramp up and scale back. 5.  Implementing safety monitoring and quality control: Safety has always been a primary concern for construction and development companies. And this is a high-impact area to start the technology drive with to get a meaningful impact. Numerous applications facilitate the tracking and reporting of safety incidents across job sites. Some new applications assist managers in investigating remote locations by providing pictures and image tags and also enable them to update and track their punch lists in real-time. Such solutions can help improve safety on construction sites. These real-time systems, combined with new technologies like GPS and building-information modeling (BIM) and artificial intelligence with other tools, can help bring about a massive, and much-needed, change in the construction industry. Technology is the principal driver of change and it will surely have a ground-breaking impact on how organizations work in the building industry. Innovative technology provides hundreds of tools for use across the project life cycle, ranging from design management to scheduling to safety monitoring. The industry is ready to change. innovative advancements are already taking over the industry and changing the way we work, design, and develop.

Theres no debate that this is a full-blown emergency. The construction industry is unable to deliver projects on time. This holds up resources, drains cash flows, and hurts profitability. This also affects their ability to bid for other projects and hurts their reputation. The AGC survey referred earlier revealed that many construction companies are looking towards innovative technology to tackle the shortage of skilled laborers. Technology likeBuilding Information Modelinghelps these companies become more efficient and effective -a valuable competitive advantage. So, its apparent that construction companies need access to quality tech talent. But are these resources easy to find? Are they easy to keep engaged and to retain? Truth be told, in centers away from Silicon Valley or New York, its hard for mid-sized construction companies to find technically-inclined people. Even the few that are there arent necessarily interested in building a career in construction. They want to work with peers who are equally tech-driven. They want access to the latest tools and to use their tech skills to make an impact. They seek opportunities to perform. Organizations need to use powerful tactics to win the war for talent. Retention is driven by an understanding of what drives such top talent, such as: Providing opportunities for personal and professional growth. Leadership training programs. Providing opportunities and tools to enable them to perform up to their potential. Invest in diversity. Hands-on experience on up to date and cutting-edge technology. Heres how an organization can build a tech team, even in the face of such challenges: Getting connected with tech-specialized partners:Technology is a network that extends far beyond the company or organization. Partnering with a skilled partner organization that has the experience will enable the construction company to gain insights into how technology works in their context. This will also give the tech staff within the company the opportunity to learn from industry experts. The staff of the partner firm can associate with the existing employees, including architects, designers, and project managers, and provide them hands-on exposure. This can contribute to improved methods and the opportunity for contextual learning. Allowing their tech staff to interface with the partner will help provide them opportunities to expand their high-performance horizons and allow them to feel associated with the latest technology. Hiring a BIM partner:Turning to specific project delivery,hiring an expert BIM partnerwill offer the organization the opportunity to launch their own BIM initiative, even as they see an immediate impact from the power of BIM in live projects. The ideal BIM partner will be able to work on theBIM modelsand then handhold the internal team as the model gets rolled out, adopted, and modified on an ongoing basis. This high-touch engagement will allow the internal tech resources the opportunity to experience real-world issues and solutions. They can start building out the processes and workflows that would become necessary to adopt once the organization embraces BIM on a larger scale. The BIM partners experience of having been there, done that will help make that a bit easier. Of course, it becomes essential to consider the experience of the BIM partner. Also, if they can provide advice, technical knowledge, and standards documentation? Foster continuous learning and career development:Organizations need to foster the aspects that matter to the tech generation like learning, training, and career development opportunities. Constant learning and development opportunities are essential in a radically changing work environment. Construction organizations should integrate continuous learning and development through academics, training sessions or workshops. Offering incentives and support to learning will attract more tech-focused people to the organization and induce the folks already there to stay on. Company culture:The organizations culture is one of the key must-haves for tech talent. Creating a fantastic company culture will help retain as well as attract people. Projecting vibrancy and positivity in the workplace is extremely critical to overcoming the perception that construction companies are hide-bound, boring, traditional, and backward-looking. By setting out a strong vision and creating a fearless culture, even construction organizations can appear modern and relevant. The construction industry needs to implement a corporate culture that challenges its employees and embraces innovation. It is now incumbent on this industry to break down traditional methods and introduce new ways to resonate with young tech talents. It is also essential for these organizations to offer employees development opportunities and the room to experiment. This will enable the employee to realize their full potential and will, in turn, contribute towards the companys growth. A potential employee should see the opportunity to boost their career and deliver up to their own expectations. Organizations need to focus on the need to provide employees with new and exciting opportunities to learn and master their craft. Organizing and delivering practical training sessions will help the employees stay updated but they only go so far. In that context, aligning with an expert technology partner organization over the initial phases of kicking off the organization will help provide such a training context. Employees can learn while working. They can see the impact of the technology that is being rolled out. As that impact gets recognized by the rest of the organization, it also helps create the sense that the organization is willing to give tech a chance. This assures the newbie techie of the possibility of a meaningful future within the organization. Thats a powerful incentive to stay on. Construction organizations could employ these practices to create empowering and enabling environments for their tech employees. That will help them grow a tech cadre that can drive their projects to faster and more profitable completion.  3 technology waves that may pass you by and how to avoid them What Makes Onshore Offshore the Most Effective Way to Manage Construction Projects with BIM  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

He put forward a USD 2 trillion infrastructure plan designed to create employment, upgrade the infrastructure and tackle climate change. President Bidens vision is to create a robust infrastructure that is safe, environment-friendly, and can withstand climate change. He has allocated more than USD 600 billion to ramp up the existing infrastructure through this plan: including railways, bridges, ports, and highways. However, repairing existing infrastructure has its own set of challenges. Traffic interruptions during construction and repair are one of the primary challenges in road and railway projects, and the management of ground utilities like sewage lines, telephone cables, water supply, etc is complex as well. People will still be commuting by roads, rail, and airports that are undergoing renovations or upgrades. While completing the project on time is a priority, construction planners and managers have to ensure that the daily commute isn't interrupted. If these nuances are not considered during the planning stage, clashes may arise during implementation, which culminates in rework and project delays. In addition, weak contract management and lack of coordination between project stakeholders cause further delays and losses. Radical infrastructure transformation calls for meticulous planning, designing, and timely project completion. The buck stops at every step, therefore making the deployment of the right digital solutions quintessential. The way we see it, Building Information Modeling (BIM) should be the first step towards infrastructure upgradation in the USA. The Swedish transport administration, Trafikverket, which manages the design, construction, and maintenance of all state-owned roads and railways offers a good case study. Since 1994, Trafikverket has been implementing BIM in rail projects; Hallandss tunnel project being one of them. Considering the on-ground challenges like high-water pressure, excavation through hard rock, soft rock, and clay, Trafikverket implemented BIM for streamlined planning and engineering and timely project delivery of the Hallandss tunnel project. During the tunneling, the real-time ground conditions were fed into the 3D model that helped stakeholders assess design errors and other risks in engineering. The shared model kept all stakeholders abreast with the project progress and ensured smooth coordination. With the help of BIM, project members could identify around 200 non-constructable conflicts and 3,000 unique collisionsat the design stage, which led to a saving of around 4.5 millionpounds on the project. (Source: The Informed Infrastructure magazine, May 2014 issue) The utilization of BIM models can extend way beyond design, as it stores data at every construction phase and beyond. Parameters like quantities of raw materials, cost estimation, scheduling and monitoring construction progress, resources deployed, safety and sustainability statistics, etc can be computed. BIM models can also be used in simulation studies to gauge the impact of natural disasters on any asset.BIM makes Assets better managed after disasters. Such information arms the project team in decision-making at the early design stage, and in taking corrective action, thereby, reducing the financial burden of repairs in the future. In high flood zone areas, using model-based flood analysis and simulation, project members can gauge potential flooding damage on infrastructure and modify the designs. For example, changing the elevation on the road can mitigate risks in a flood-prone area. So far, we have only heard stories about the far-reaching effects of the pandemic on the US economy. The President's vision will strengthen the country's backbone and make the aging infrastructure future-ready. We are confident that BIM can offer a competitive edge to planners, construction firms, architects, and all others who will carry the torch of the Presidents vision. BIM can certainly be the fulcrum for building a robust, resource-efficient, and sustainable infrastructure in USA!

However, the recent pandemic has compelled them to embrace technology to continue working without flouting the guidelines. Apart from using collaboration tools, IoT sensors, and cloud-based software to connect with remote teams, the industry has started to significantly ramp up the usage of established technologies like Building Information Management (BIM) more actively too. BIM adoption has grown to such an extent that Autodesk, one of the leading companies developing BIM software has reported a 350% increase in the global BIM adoption rate ever since COVID-19 compelled the adoptions of different safety standards and a global shift of work from the office to home. According to the Global Building Information Model market report, the BIM market will grow at a CAGR of 11.2% from 2019 to 2026. It is poised to become a market of $9.81 billion by 2026. BIM is expected to evolve further in the years to come. As we come to the end of 2020, lets look at how BIM will continue to evolve in 2021 and how it will benefit the construction industry. How Would BIM Evolve In 2021? Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR and VR) BIM and 3D modeling help clients get a better perspective about how the building model would look, but they would have less visibility into other designing options. AR and VR could change that. They are expected to give greater power to the clients to choose. Brandon Mikeal, a leading BIM engineer, says that architects can use AR to show the various options of a building model on their tablet. It can also be used to catch errors in the models before something is installed at the site. VR can be used to give the client a walkthrough of every part of the building so they can choose the specific features they want. He believes these options could drive sales for construction companies. It will also give them a competitive advantage over other construction companies that dont make such technology choices. Cloud adoption Its natural for clashes and errors to occur as the project moves towards the construction process. Identifying and fixing these clashes is one of the principal value propositions of BIM. For that to happen, all stakeholders must have access to the same data from the site to assess the progress of the project. This ensures a clash-free plan, which in turn saves the time and costs of the contractors on rework. As there are several stakeholders involved in a project, real-time data sharing from the site becomes tedious. It becomes even more challenging when the data set is large. To streamline the BIM data sharing process, companies have started to use cloud-based applications. The stakeholders are given access to the cloud application, so they can easily refer and use the data even if they are working remotely. Companies have started to witness improvement in their processes thanks to the increased collaboration between different members. Collaboration tools While we are on the topic of collaborative efforts, lets look at how collaboration tools can help BIM to evolve. Typically, architects, engineers, and building designers use BIM to create the blueprint. This design is saved and shared with the contractors on site. However, there are always times when the design would have to undergo certain changes. To ensure seamless communication, companies can integrate BIM with collaboration tools. This will enable the stakeholders involved in the project to make changes quickly and get the work started without any miscommunication. 80% of the average cost overrun happens due to change orders. With improved collaborations, companies can reduce the change orders and ensure that the work gets done quickly and efficiently. Enriched 3D modeling To provide the clients with a clear understanding of how the final building would look, companies can opt for an enriched 3D BIM model. This is a value-added development of the BIM model, supplemented with more visual appeal and descriptive context. It can be used to design floor plans, elevations, and other spaces by taking snapshots from different perspectives. The best part of using such 3D BIM modeling services is that it allows the model to remain consistent even if there is a minor change in one of the elements by baking in processes that allow constant updating. So, the architect does not have to work on all the elements again to make the model consistent. Drones BIM specialists could face a tough time while covering a large area of the site within a short duration or when they are working remotely. Thats when a drone can prove to be useful. BIM specialists can use drones to capture accurate data of a large area by hovering it over the site. Over time, this also enables the specialists to track the progress of the project, so they can refine the model based on the insights received by the drone. It can also be used to survey and record data from rough terrains that are usually risky to tread for supervisors. Conclusion The construction industry has used BIM for more than four decades. It has helped construction companies streamline their operations and save costs. However, it could well prove to be a game-changer during COVID-19 by ensuring smooth operations when the teams were located at separate locations. Even as vaccines get developed, we expect companies to continue using BIM to complete their projects without any hassles, especially in innovative new ways. All they need is the right BIM implementation partner who will help them to leverage BIM to its optimum level!  How Architects Use BIM for Design Is BIM Adoption Waning?

Coordination between the groups of architects, designers, engineers, contractors, and specialist contractors has always been a major challenge in the construction industry. Streamlining the work, especially in large-scale projects, is vital. Errors in judgment or execution can result in loss of time and money -both scarce commodities. Let me paraphrase from a NICMAR report that I found. Studies across various construction projects in many different countries found that the major causes for delays in projects were: Design changes by the owners during construction Errors in the planning stages Poor site management Delay in producing design documents Lack of effective communication And whats the impact? The same study says that (at the time of the examination) 49.6% of the time in construction was devoted to wasteful activities. A developing country like India cannot afford to lose out due to such preventable issues. Today, the country is undergoing significant public infrastructure development in every town and city. Over the next 5 years, India plans to turn a whopping 50 cities into smart cities, and infrastructure work for it has already begun. TheNagpur Metro Rail Projectis one such major infrastructure project undertaken by the Maharashtra Government. Under this project, an elevated metro corridor, spanning over 40 km across the city with 36 stations and 2 depots is being constructed. The project is well on the way to completion and trial runs have already begun. Its fair to say that it is one of the fastest infrastructure projects being carried out in the country today. Controlling cost in such largescale projects is a herculean task. The most effective way of managing cost is by planning and collaborating better and eliminating discrepancies in the design and estimated time and raw materials required for the completion of the project. Nagpur Metro is also one of those major public infrastructure projects which have successfully used and implementedBuilding Information Modelling(BIM). I have been personally involved in this aspect of the project, and I am sure that BIM has allowed Nagpur Metro to reap benefits in the form of cost-cutting and time-saving. Nagpur Metro Rail Project leveraged BIM to accelerate work and control costs. During a conference in Singapore in 2017, Mr. Brijesh Dixit  MD, Nagpur Metro Rail Project highlighted the following points: Cost savings of around 12% has been achieved concerning logistics travel and staff days. It is expected to grow up to 15% by the end of the completion of the project.  Savings in time around 8% have been achieved which is likely to rise to 11% by the end of the project. The end of the project anticipates a reduction of overhead costs from 5% to 3.5%. Cost savings of around 8% is expected over the DPR projected costs. How did BIM help in achieving this? Just repeating that BIM is software that helps in generating a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. The 3D representation allows architects, engineers, and builders to plan, design, manage, and execute the project efficiently. The data related to the facility is saved in the form of digital files that is accessible to all the stakeholders in the project. This centralisation of data helps in eliminating duplication, thereby avoiding confusion during the execution phase. BIM uses six dimensions (6D) to create a holistic construction plan. These six dimensions are: Width/Length Depth/Breadth Height Time Cost As-built /Facilities management The inclusion of the 4th and 5th dimension helps in making accurate projections about the time and estimation of costs required to complete the project. The 6th Dimension, As-Built/Facilities management helps in having accurate information of any updates during construction which will help with facilities management. Every infrastructure project evolves during construction, and it becomes difficult to keep track of these changes. The As-Built is the final drawing of the facility which incorporates every small little change that is made in the actual design during the construction process. This becomes precious information for the ongoing maintenance of the project even after construction is completed. Why make BIM Mandatory for Public Infrastructural Work? Before answering the why, lets look at the benefits of implementing BIM: Helps in accelerating the completion of the project by facilitating better planning Helps in saving and cutting down construction cost through clash detection Helps in saving through construction process simulation Helps in eliminating unbudgeted changes Helps in reducing the request for information or missing information Helps in reducing the time required to generate estimates Helps in better collaboration between the various stakeholders Think of all the extensive public infrastructure work going on in the country today. Now, think of executing those infrastructure projects with the help of BIM. BIM will not only help in cutting costs but will also help in driving faster project completion. UK made the use of BIM mandatory in public infrastructure projects a couple of years ago. Last year a report by PwC estimated that on a projected public infrastructure spend of GBP 31.7 Billion on 2018/19, public funds to the tune of GBP 429 Million could be saved. Thats in 1 year! The Nagpur Metro Rail Project is an example of how effective BIM-driven construction can prove to be for public infrastructure projects. Today, the Metro work in Nagpur has been more than 40% complete. This has been achieved within 2 years. To me the choice is clear, and it is inevitable, I appeal to the Government of India to make BIM mandatory for every public infrastructure project being carried out in the country today. Its the need of the hour!

Is Indian Construction Sector About To Enter A New Era Of Transparency, Efficiency & Organization? When we were in school and asked to attempt a complex problem, wed use a rough paper to work out the tougher calculations. This would help us make our mistakes early and fix them. Similarly, while constructing some of the most important sites in the world  it makes complete sense to make a rough version first to ensure the final product is devoid of problems and errors. While this metaphor may seem simplistic, it suits the relation between construction and Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM is now an established technology in construction globally. It enhances how data is organized, improves operational efficiency, and generates transparency. Experts project the global BIM market to reach $15,892 million by 2027  registering a CAGR of 15.2% from 2020 to 2027. While North America dominates this market, studies show that the Asia Pacific will exhibit the highest growth rate here, due to the booming construction industry. It stands to reason that one of the key players in this market must be India. But is India ready to adopt this technology? Lets take a look. Overview of Indian Construction Sector By 2025, India will be the third-largest construction market and will contribute approximately 13% to the countrys GDP. It should hit US$1 trillion by 2030. These sunny forecasts are due to the consistent growth of the sector. In 2017, it was the most employed sector in India, as it employed around 51 million people. A key part of the sector concerns urban development projects, such as highway construction, transport, healthcare infrastructure, etc. Along with its already immense scope, there are continuing plans to include modernizing existing infrastructure, developing smart cities, improving transportation routes, and more. Additionally, there are plans to craft an ambitious National Infrastructure Pipeline  which should prove to be a real game-changer. With so many exciting events constantly happening in this sector, its no surprise that even in 2020, just the real estate sector itself received foreign investments of over US$5 billion. The Indian construction industry offers several investment opportunities for foreign companies, but the question is whether this hugely lucrative sector will retain transparency, efficiency, and organization with such entrenched practices. We know that international companies entering the Indian market desire such openness and structure. From the way things are looking, the answer is a resounding yes. This is mostly thanks to government policies and the industry itself striving to follow best practices. Lets explore a few of the reasons that should safeguard the integrity of this sector. Attracting direct investment from foreign investors with fewer barriers. The government allows 100% FDI in infrastructure, SEZs, and industrial parks. Already, $17 billion has been invested through these routes over the past two decades. As the country rises out of the pandemic, this number should go up. Especially since foreign investors benefit from being able to invest in construction projects without needing approval from the government. By injecting FDI into this sector, the government is breaking domestic monopolies, creating a competitive market, and bringing international best practices into the sector. This is beneficial in many other ways as it pushes firms to strengthen their processes and improve their offerings. Businesses become exposed to the latest international tools and technologies, as well as operational practices. Over time, these influence everyone, which results in enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the industry as a whole. International companies focus on adopting more structured, data-driven, and transparent ways of working. Global projects of large-scale work with a huge amount of data and resources. Its not enough to make decisions based solely on instinct with so many factors and people involved. This is why these companies have invested in tools and skills to streamline their processes. For instance, Building Information Modelling enables information exchange and effective project lifecycle management in real estate, construction, architecture, construction, and engineering. Apart from the operational improvements (those are well-known), the use of BIM also brings in transparency, accuracy, and estimation quality. This is why international entities have adopted such tools to streamline and optimize collaboration and planning. These companies are conscious of the need for agility and innovation, but value predictability and order. The power players on the global scale place great importance on stability. They believe that predictability and order are important to drive sustainable growth. Again, its the technology that is enhancing systematic processes and increasing the certainty of decisions. For eg., BIM delivers more efficient estimates, transparent tracking, and ongoing visibility. This provides greater cost and resource savings, greater efficiency and shorter project lifecycles, improved communications and coordination, higher quality results, and more opportunities for leveraging modern technology like prefabrication and modular construction. Using tools like this helps companies progress at an orderly pace. Modern construction companies appreciate building methods that leverage the power of technology like BIM. They know how this will help them make better plans, achieve greater visibility into ongoing progress, and optimize resource procurement and utilization. For any Indian entity to take advantage of the government's truly excellent policies to attract FDI or to compete with international players, they must have these technologies in place. This will show that theyre ready to go to the international stage, armed with excellent technology thats on par with the global players. It also sends a strong message that theyre committed to transparency and efficiency. This acts as a signal that there will be ease of communication, organization, and operations. With the advent of foreign companies entering the Indian construction sector, a new era of transparency, efficiency, and organization will inevitably begin and technology and design software will power this.

Its probably just as well known that BIM serves as a common knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for a variety of choices during that lifecycle. BIM creates a common language between all the parties involved in a construction project and brings them together on an integrated platform. BIM becomes the framework to plan, collaborate, and evaluate the cost and time performance of projects. In essence, it draws a big picture of a project using visualization. Central to BIM is its accurate geometrical representation of the parts of a structure in an integrated data environment. Other related benefits naturally follow: Enhanced project collaboration Better project quality and execution Improved productivity Faster project delivery Reduced construction costs New revenue and business opportunities But with that array of benefits, there are some complexities the construction industry must address with regards to BIM. The cost of BIM: The biggest concern for any business organization is the cost of adopting BIM. The initial expense of the solution is not a major problem. BIM implementation is not complete just by upgrading of software. To draw out the full benefits, all the related components of business operations from applications to vendor component specifications would have to be integrated into a coherent system. Additionally, different levels of training would be required. And then theres the cost of specialist BIM talent. And speaking of talent.  Lack of BIM experts: Most construction companies do not have sufficient staff equipped to deploy BIM techniques and principles. Hiring these people seems like an obvious solution but thats not so easy too. Especially for small and mid-sized construction companies in locations away from the major technology centers, its hard to find people skilled in technology and amenable to make their career in such organizations.  Data exchange: Data exchange between teams has traditionally been something the construction industry has never been great at. This problem could be exacerbated by BIM. BIM models have complex 3D geometry, behaviour, and a lot of data attached to each object. Also, BIM models deliver tremendous volumes of data to the onsite construction teams on a regular basis. This suggests a consistent and high volume bidirectional flow of information is necessary. Creating and maintaining that level of data exchange could become a problem for traditional construction companies.  Level of project complexity: Construction projects range in complexity from the trivial to the truly massive. The issues are very different as the projects become larger. BIM users having insufficient experience in addressing complex projects may actually cause critical coordination problems while trying to implement BIM for such projects.  Cultural issues: Changing a long-established method of working can cause some problems. Processes would have to change, entrenched habits would have to be transformed, and new layers of reporting, monitoring, and feedback would have to be deployed. BIM has its own characteristics that need addressing. Combined with the staff skills issue this could cause friction between teams and management layers. This could impact BIM adoption on site as well as reduce the impact of the implementation. There are a variety of changes that could be undertaken by a construction organization to successfully adopt BIM. Seek a BIM service partner: A painless way to kick off your BIM journey is to partner with a BIM service provider organization who can understand your requirements, be it architecture, structure, design coordination, or development plans. A BIM service provider will bring the required expertise and experience to the table that can all but eliminate the hurdles that may arise in the project.  Make it realizable to everyone: With the adoption of BIM, there can be paradigm shifts that can be experienced at every stage of structural development. Drive home to everyone involved the benefits of the platform and the new collaborative approach. Focus the training on the specific context of the benefits of the solution to their day-to-day work. Make it obvious how this will help them do better at their jobs.  Train even your BIM trainers: While it is a given that training is fundamental, imparting training to the correct sources at the right time is more crucial and important. Training to get acquainted with BIM culture and characteristics, processes, roles, practices, and workflow is important. Providing the right training to the project managers along with the team is vital in this context. This can help ensure that the BIM strategy is deployed successfully and meaningfully. Like with any transformative new solution, the initial challenges can seem formidable. But once overcome, the benefits are too many to ignore.  4 Great things I see emerging from Airport Authority of India's BIM advocacy Can BIM help construction projects in extreme or hazardous locations?

Some great advancement has taken place over time. Technology is powering better plans of action. The traditional ways are being improved with a new set of principles that hope to encourage the value of digital processes while embracing changes in disruptive technologies. As engineers and contractors unite to discover new and better methods of collaborating and delivering projects, the capability of BIM processes is now acknowledged to deliver better project performance through more streamlined methods. The ability to capture, design, and simulate various infrastructure resources is progressing and providing new levels of visualization. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is now an accepted method, supported by technology, to collaborate better and share data across the lifecycle of aconstructionproject. It has also, for long, been a catalyst for a change in the way we manage, design and develop a construction project. BIM promotes more structured real-time capture of project data. Over the process, it brings more accuracy to the building construction and enables the exchange of significant project information between the various stakeholders. Moreover, further developments in BIM are slated to make construction projects more productive and affordable by including revolutionary sustainability and safety measures. But the value of BIM is only now becoming apparent as an enabler for tomorrows technology movements. BIMs comprehensive data gathering, structured and seamless collaboration, and better integration with other software solutions like ERP systems could unlock even greater value by forming the foundation for some truly disruptive process. Here are 3 technology waves that will have to depend on BIM in one way or the other for their widespread application. Artificial Intelligence: In terms of project design and planning, AI can make a huge impact from initial design modeling, to project planning, to ongoing diagnostics. Of course, AI heavily dependents on data. And that comprehensive, structured, and accurate data can be best captured from BIM. With BIM driving AI, architects, designers, and contractors, can visualize an entire project and experience construction progress in real-time even before it happens. Complex interactions between parameters and factors can be baked into these visualizations. Also, safety on a construction site requires the proper foresight, planning, and protocol. BIM with real-time AI can equip construction site managers with the insights they need to ensure safety for themselves and all the team members on the site. Potential on-site risks could be eliminated through prior warning. Heavy machinery, such as cranes, loaders, and trucks, can be more easily coordinated on the construction site. Augmented Reality: Augmented reality is an emerging trend in the construction industry because of its ability to visualise a modified version of the real world through a lens. Just like BIM is a way to build a structure virtually before you build physically, AR is a way to see (and experience) virtually before you build. Augmented reality paired with BIM can help provide accurate and detailed comparisons between what has been planned with what has been built to evaluate progress and deviations on the spot. Such implementation of augmented reality in building and construction processes can help save money on rework. Another advantage of using augmented reality is that people can collaborate and solve problems effectively even while being in different locations. AR can also be used to provide training that is more immersive and contextual. In such situations, using the BIM model as a base will help ensure that everyone is working with a single version of the truth. This will ensure consistency and accuracy. Sustainable construction: Sustainable design has turned into a strategic imperative in recent years. Today, the focus is both on building green and on green buildings. Its also apparent that much of sustainability in building practices is about reducing waste in materials as well as in energy and expense. And BIM plays a crucial role in promoting that. BIM is an ideal catalyst to drive sustainable building practices as well as improved and more energy-efficient building performance. Consider this in the context of making environment-friendly material choices and energy-efficient construction practices. Both need to be based on a solid foundation of comprehensive planning, accurate information, and real-time monitoring. The delivery of data required for these improvements is a key value of BIM. The most significant benefits of BIM for sustainable building design are: 1) Integrated project delivery 2) Design optimisation. BIM has helped construction professionals deliver complex and involved construction projects around the world. But as the world of construction is changing, its time for the role of BIM to evolve too. A data-driven sector with an emphasis on technological improvements and real-time collaboration is around the corner. And BIM will play a central role in that too.

(BIM) is getting rapidly established as an innovative method to design virtually and manage structures. An AGC survey revealed that nearly 1 in 3 organizations see technology as an appropriate response to address the growing labor shortage by driving up productivity and improving planning. A growing number of construction organizations have made initial investments and are adopting the practice of including BIM in their projects. For those that came in late, Building Information Modelling or BIM is a method of working in the construction industry that helps firms plan better, execute faster, and manage resources optimally. The key benefits of BIM include:  Faster and more effective processes  Better design  Better production quality  Automated assembly While adoption is growing, its, perhaps, fair to say that the rise of BIM has been slower than it should be. Even as the crescendo builds around thebenefits of BIM, it is still proving difficult for some organizations to quantify the value of the benefits it brings. Many organizations have implemented pilot projects with BIM. Quite a few have seen benefits too. But they have stopped short of rolling out the initiative across the organizations. Shortage of skilled tech talent Its no secret that the construction industry suffers severe worker shortages. In many ways, the situation is even direr for specialized skills like technology. The number of qualified tech people is quite low to start with. To add to that, attracting these folks to the construction business is proving hard in the face of more glamorous options in the tech sector. The problem is even more severe for the small and mid-sized tech companies located in the smaller towns and locations away from the major tech hubs. Whats the scalability of an enterprise-wideBIM initiativeif you dont have the people to make it run seamlessly for a sustained duration? This is a challenge that can be addressed by partnering with a company that has the BIM expertise and the people available to scale up a BIM initiative. But is that enough? Cultural changes in the construction industry The lack of experience of BIM within an industry as traditional as construction creates hindrances in the proper utilization of the software. This is not a comment on their inability to use the software properly. Its more a commentary on the rigidity of current processes and ways of working. The introduction of advanced technologies and ideas in the workplace can be a daunting change. Theimplementation of BIMcan benefit the company in the long run. However, such solutions increase demands for transparency, accountability, collaboration, and communications. In adopting these changes, employees may face problems. They may find it difficult to change their way of working. They may be apprehensive about the impact on their jobs. They may also worry about their ability to learn new solutions and be confused about how to utilize the BIM models in the context of their specific roles. Organizations and project managers need to consider the possible mitigation strategies to address these challenges before implementing BIM to overcome the hurdles. While introducing BIM to the employees, issues such as experience, culture, support, training, and education need to be clearly addressed. Therefore, companies must educate their employees and provide effective training to ensure everyone is on board. So, apart from pulling in the BIM experts, what a construction company needs is hand-holding as the BIM adoption challenges work themselves out. The people in these companies need the ear and hand of someone who has been there, done that with BIM to show them the way and to drive home the positive impact BIM could deliver to their own performance. But what next? Return on Investment calculations Adopting BIM can show a positive impact at all stages of the construction lifecycle from design and construction to maintenance. However, the perception of ROI is always shifting. Some impact is quite easily provable. For instance, the savings that can accrue because of better material estimates that the BIM model provides can be enumerated quite easily when compared to previous gut-feel estimates. But organizations that are unused to the technology sometimes struggle to quantify the impact in broader terms. For instance, schedule adherence may result but how much of that is down to BIM and how much just better execution? Its true that many organizations that incorporatedBIM in their projects reported a positive ROI.Organizations that invest more in training and in the full adoption of BIM also see a positive effect. It seems that BIM helps organizations to construct better structures and increase profitability. But how can that be measured for the CFO? An organization implementing BIM could find it difficult to define the financial models that show the impact BIM is having. Many of these assessments are driven by the experience. At such times, turning to a partner who has that experience could help drive more reasoned assessments of the ROI. Its in situations like this that small and mid-sized construction firms across the USA partner withExcelize.

How is BIM central to construction technology disruption? Construction used to be a traditional industry where things moved at a slow pace. But no more. Innovation and trends in the construction industry have kept pace with the rise in demand for new advancements. Technological advancements are now driving the construction industry forward at a pace not seen earlier. For instance, drones make it possible to study and map a site easily, faster, and at a lower cost. Smartphones and tablets make communications a breeze. Digital applications and other software-driven solutions make it possible to map out even the nitty-gritty of a project. Even the use of robots is seemingly within easy reach. New technological advances are continually changing the construction industry. Technology seems set to cause unimagined disruption in the construction industry. This change is enabling us to build taller, stronger, and more energy-efficient structures. Technology has also made construction sites safer and workers more efficient. This has led to an increase in productivity, improved collaboration, and coordination, and easier handling of more complex projects. Today, new advancements in construction are being developed at a faster pace. But it is also true that Building Information Modeling could well be the most vital element driving most or all of these technological innovations. A few of the technologies that are moulding todays construction site and the role of BIM are listed below: 1.  AI & Machine Learning:Construction firms are currently using data to settle on better choices, increase productivity, improve safety on construction sites and reduce risks. With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning systems, firms can turn the information they have gathered over the years to predict future results on projects and gain an advantage when estimating and offering on construction ventures. AI also improves worker efficiency and productivity by reducing the amount of time wasted, moving about the site to retrieve instruments, materials, and tools to perform specific tasks.But where will these technologies get extensive, current, and strategic data about the structure to be impactful? BIM is the obvious place to turn to. In fact, when you extend the discussion to Big Data and Analytics, the value becomes even greater. Construction firms are turning to analytics to get data-driven insights that help them improve efficiencies as well as effectiveness. Analytics is helping them understand trends in work that has already happened and make predictions about work that could be coming up. In that scenario too, the comprehensive, current, and coherent information available from the BIM models can amplify the impact of the Big Data and Analytics initiatives. 2.  Robots & drones:Robots are also being utilized to monitor job-site progress with real-time, vital information to improve work productivity. Drones and rovers equipped with high-definition cameras are being used to click pictures and scan the construction site every day with accuracy. Drones are already in use at construction sites. Drones can survey entire sites in a shorter span which helps to save much time, which also leads to saving a great deal in labour costs as it requires less human involvement.But these technologies are expensive. Their use must be strategically directed. Every action must be carefully planned. It would be hard to achieve that level of accurate direction without basing it all on an accurate and updated BIM model. In return, the model can also be enriched with the latest and most accurate information captured by the drones. There is synergy all around. 3.  Cloud & Mobile Technology:Today, mobile devices are ubiquitous. Most software solutions are also primed to utilize cloud technology. The coming together of these two factors ensure that it is always easy to use and operate cloud-based software from anyplace, at any time. The advantages of cloud-based software include the inexpensive storage of limitless amounts of data that can be accessed instantly. This is making rich project information available to all members of the project team. But when married to the power of BIM this combination can deliver unprecedented value. Think of how this can improve collaboration between teams on-site, for instance. The BIM model can become the commonly accessible, single version of the truth all the teams refer to and base their plans on. This will ensure smooth work, fewer clashes, better work planning, and smarter resolution of issues. 4.  Augmented & Virtual Reality:Virtual Reality provides workers with exposure to situations such as confined spaces or working at height in a safe and protected environment. Virtual reality (VR) is beneficial in providing construction site safety training and equipment operator training. Augmented reality (AR) is another innovative technology that can significantly improve safety on the construction site. There are various ways that AR can be deployed on construction sites. It assists in developing a more detailed safety plan and provides training on heavy equipment. When allied with robust BIM models the AR and VR strategies can become much richer, more detailed, nuanced, and impactful. That will ensure that the AR/VR driven training can set the information the workers are being exposed to in a specific context. This will make the training much more meaningful and impactful. We know that BIM helps to visualize the finished structure with all its segments and systems before the construction even begins. Potential issues and difficulties can be recognized and fixed to avoid physical errors, damages, and costly revisions. Designers and contractors can benefit from the technology by incorporating it right from the design stage.BIM generates a digital representation of structures in 3D models to facilitate better cooperation. This leads to better design and development of buildings. The kind of vivid visualization made possible by BIM helps in better collaboration and communication. Even with these innovative technologies contributing to the success of the construction industry, its clear that one technique that retains relevance in these technological advancements is BIM.

The construction sector must recognize and understand the significance of implementing versatile construction technologies for business impact. The construction industry is evolving every year, which implies that companies need innovative technology-based solutions that will assist them in adapting to the continually changing needs of their customers and to face up to the challenges of the new age. The business is competitive, economic conditions are inconsistent, cash flow is always tight, and profitability is constrained. But even as the construction industry is considering embracing technology it is not exempt from the difficulties of adopting these new advanced digital technologies. To choose and adopt an advanced technology suitable for such traditional organizations is usually a long and rocky road. Theres a tricky balance to be maintained here. This post is about that balance. As the complexity of construction projects increases, companies that are enhancing and incorporating these new technological advancements and digital tools into their organizations are setting themselves up for success in the future. Those that refuse to innovate and adapt and continue to work the same way; they are likely to struggle to keep pace. Building Information Modellingand project management software, and the growing capabilities of mobile devices can help construction companies with scheduling, planning, and estimation. The coming together of these solutions can enhance communication and collaboration between teams. This can help construction companies deliver better quality projects, in a shorter time, and with optimized effort outlays. Better estimation can help reduce waste. Better communication and collaboration can reduce clashes and rework. All of this can lead to better effectiveness, greater efficiency, and higher profitability. Drones and wearable can be used to monitor workers and ongoing work and keep people safe on construction sites. VR can be used to train workers in safe conditions. Robots and other equipment will allow workers to be more productive by easing some of the strenuous tasks. These technologies can help construction become safer, improve compliance with rules and regulations, and also be more green and sustainable. The advantages of implementing innovative construction technology include:  Avoid costly errors  Increase in revenue  Improve customer satisfaction  Decrease liability issues  Increase safety & security  Stay up-to-date  Flexible documentation  Increase worker accountability  Better communication Clearly, companies that are embracing new tech stand to gain significant advantages. Regardless of all the clichs about the reality of change, the truth is that it can be hard for people to acknowledge impactful alterations to the way they do things. This is especially true in the association we have with technology-based products because the change can be very fundamental. The result is that construction businesses continue to under-invest in innovations, even though there are significant benefits the technology can provide to their construction projects. The challenges are many. The ability to diminish old or redundant frameworks and focus on high-value systems that will guarantee productivity and reduce cost is essential in the construction industry. But making this switch from legacy systems is hard and disruptive. As more innovations penetrate the enterprise, organizations must have adequate IT specialists on their teams and access to a large digitally savvy workforce. The existing staff may need to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology. But is it easy for these companies to train their existing people? And is it even feasible for them to hire technology resources, engage, motivate, challenge, and retain them in the face of competition from technology-specific companies from centers like Silicon Valley? In fact, access to tech-savvy resources may be the single biggest barrier to the adoption of technology for small and mid-sized construction companies. These companies need to invest time and resources, executive support, offer robust training, and create autonomy and adaptability to track and measure key metrics. Many of these areas call for a cultural change, revamped organizational workflows, and changes to the operational and performance metrics the organization has become used to. Such changes are excruciatingly hard to implement. Despite the challenges, we are rapidly reaching the point where tech-driven innovation will become a critical component of all construction projects. At that point, the organizations that are early adopters and are implementing the changes into their workflows will have a noticeable advantage over those that dont. Picking, validating, and adopting technology is all about planning and executing correctly. The solution may be to start with planning and then move to implement innovative technology in stages. Defining priorities, achieving small wins, and driving incremental change that everyone can see, sense, and be a part of could help the new ways take root. Talent constraints can be addressed by finding a technology partner with the available bandwidth to help you kick off your own technology initiative. This kind of partnership will help your organization get started with the benefit of hand-holding from an expert who would have been there, done that. The construction industry is on the cusp of a digital transformation that could lead to the downfall of companies that refuse to adapt to the advancements. Technology from drones to robots to Building Information Modelling (BIM) and big data is rapidly changing how the construction and development industry will design and build structures. Its up to these companies to sort out their complicated relationship with technology to live long and prosper.

The industry has been growing steadily from 2015 to 2020 and continues to be the largest employer and a key pillar of the economy. That said, there are several challenges associated with the Indian construction sector and poor labour productivity is one of those significant concerns. Quite often, poor labour productivity is mapped with Indias construction sector but the root cause of the challenge is seldom assessed. So, why is productivity low? Many factors contribute to limited productivity in Indian construction. The ratio of contracted labour and in-house labour is one major reason. Other factors include the shortage of skilled labour and the lack of labour welfare policies. Safe working conditions are one more area to focus on. Workplace accidents lead to approximately 48,000 deaths per year in India and 38 fatal accidents are reported per day across Indian constructionsites. These numbers are alarming enough in themselves but accidents also pose a major productivity challenge due to time taken by stoppages, inspections, investigations, etc. Companies and contractors also hesitate to use the latest technologies and tools due to the costs involved, fear of inability to manage the changes, and additional requirements of training the workers. Turning around a few strategies can drive a marked improvement in productivity on Indias construction site. Digital tools and remote tracking Technology can be used by construction managers and leaders to resolve productivity issues and other benefits. It is essential to continuously monitor the construction site and ongoing activities to identify gaps and fix them. Drones and body cameras are some technological innovations that can be used intelligently on Indian construction sites. These devices will enable managers to obtain real-time site information. The issues, such as the possibility of an accident, improper usage of the construction tool, lack of workers in a particular area, etc. can be spotted using technology and rectified early. Construction sites are spread across a large area and managers cannot be physically present across the site at all times. Such digital tools can simplify the task for managers and leaders. At the same time, these can resolve the existing gaps to experience better productivity. Automated trackers and performance measurement tools can also be used to determine the safety situation of the construction tools and equipment. Smart maintenance schedules of the construction equipment can be developed and implemented based on the details captured. Improved tools and equipment will result in lesser workplace accidents and will assure improved productivity levels. Workplace Training Construction workflows are witnessing major changes with the launch of techniques and tools, such as Building Information Modeling, modular construction, and offsite construction. These technologies and tools can be used effectively only when construction workers and other stakeholders adapt to these tools and the new processes they bring in their wake. The impact of the changes must be explained to those impacted and they must be made to understand the benefits and the potential of such automated and computerized systems to help them improve their performance. In the long term, effective workplace training is crucial in resolving productivity challenges on Indias construction sites. Training the people on the latest tools and techniques, new workflows, health and safety measures, and communication strategies can help cement best practices that help maintain high productivity and efficiency levels. The motivation and productivity of the construction workers will also improve with proper knowledge and understanding of the tools, compliance requirements, safety practices, and techniques.This, again, helps drive up productivity. Communication is the Key It is not uncommon for construction projects in India to witness an overrun of 20-25% in terms of costs. Cost overruns are often tied to and accompanied by time slippage. Poor productivity and unexpected cost hikes have caused massive losses to the construction security in India. Maintenance of information transparency is an effective solution to resolve such concerns. Integrated project management systems, automated control systems, and intuitive communication tools can be used for non-stop connectivity and information sharing. Remote monitoring and tracking tools, as explained earlier, can provide construction managers with updated site information. Digital communications tools can be used at construction sites to maintain connectivity and resolve worker concerns in real-time. Frequent status reporting and information sharing can result in quicker resolution of problems and improved productivity through collaborative decision-making with BIM. For example, the workers can directly contact the Chief Engineers and Architects in case of site-related concerns or poor work conditions.Platforms like BIM also ensure that all the teams work on the same information. This improves collaboration and transparent communication. To Sum it Up Construction sites in India are exposed to a wide range of challenges with productivity concerns on the top of the concern charts. A combination of measures and strategies can assist the improvements in productivity levels. The use of digital tools for remote tracking, monitoring, and communication can make a huge difference. Real-time information sharing will facilitate better clarity and quick resolution of the problems. The use of project management tools, automated control systems, and performance measurement applications will also help by making equipment more available and usable. Proper maintenance and workplace training will improve the health and safety conditions of the workers. Effective communication using technologies and modified strategies will assist in improving the site productivity levels. Put these together and you get an effective holistic strategy to drive up productivity in the construction sector.  5 Barriers Construction Companies Must Overcome to Benefit from Technology The Implicit Case for BIM and building resilient infrastructure in the USA  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

As most here would know, BIM is an intelligent 3D modeling process that provides architects, designers and construction and development professionals with a tool to efficiently plan, design, and construct infrastructure. Benefits of using BIM:  Easy coordination and collaboration.  Better choices are made earlier in the process.  Projects progress can be tracked more comprehensively. Reduces construction site clashes and risks that may lead to delays during construction. BIM or Building Information Modeling framework not only contains the design or structure of a building but also the information related to the properties of various components, its construction, and maintenance. Construction companies expect that BIM will transform how project teams work and it does just that. BIM works on the principles of  implement, enable, and execute: 1. Implement:  Standards and procedures  Technology  Modeling content 2. Team enablement:  Training and education  Define and share objectives 3. Project execution:  Program coordination  Model administration  Knowledge transfer Steps to follow while building your BIM infrastructure: Step 1: Start at the ground level: Get all the equipment in order. It is important to ensure that all the infrastructure and software are up to date and can support BIM. This includes the workflows and processes for gathering information on an ongoing basis and for disseminating insights regularly. The following questions could be taken into consideration:  Can the systems handle the amount of data required to make the BIM software impactful?  Is the computing infrastructure ready and available?  Are the processes, workflows, and systems created keeping in mind the time it would take to capture data, process it, build the model, and distribute the information? There are some practical considerations to factor in too. For instance, data storage for large projects could become a significant consideration. As BIM utilizes a large amount of information, it is important to ensure that all the information stays secure yet easy to access. Step 2: Get to know BIM: Assign a team of employees to learn and understand more about BIM. The focus should be, not only, on how BIM works but also on how it influences how a team works? It is essential to gain a contextual understanding of BIM, its methodologies, and its implementation. Step 3: Assemble the right team: Like most initiatives, its good to start the BIM journey with a limited scope pilot. And, like most initiatives, the success of the project depends on theright talentavailable. It is important to pick the right set of individuals to drive the pilot project. Here are a few qualities to look for in a candidate for the pilot BIM project:  Experience in 3D design or has BIM exposure.  Understands the traditional structural plan and construction management process.  Acknowledges data and modeling techniques.  Willing to learn new software and systems quickly.  Able to coach other team members. Step 4: Develop a management plan: Adopting BIM calls for changes across various parts of the organization. Adopting aBIM strategy introduces complexityinto areas beyond just the engineering drawing department. This has been called a cultural change by many. The new way of working is more transparent and well-documented. This calls for accountability and collaboration. So, the management plan to roll out BIM across the construction enterprise would have to consider several crucial questions like:  How do the impacted teams envision BIM changing the established workflows?  Who will require training, and when will the training be provided?  How will the questions and issues of the employees be solved? What will be the hand-holding process? Who will be the BIM champion who inspires everyone else to come on board? As you can see, ongoing support is the most significant item. Organizational change will happen faster and be all the more effective when the employees will adopt new approaches for working. In that context, a significant challenge is,how to get the employees on-site to use thedata and insights provided from the BIM models? Management strategies to drive up adoption may become crucial to ensuring success. Step 5: Document the progress: Once the initial setup is over and processes defined, its crucial to capture the learnings and keep track of ongoing progress. Here are a couple of ideas to note down:  Project data, including key contacts.  Processes that develop to manage file exchanges, kick-off meetings, and quality control.  The impact of BIM in defining the vision for site design and analysis.  The impact of BIM on improving cost estimation for materials and operations. Step 6: Get your team to speed: The next step in the BIM transformation is leveraging the foundation already prepared. The most significant instrument of change will be the employees who have seen the magic. These BIM champions can advocate for adoption across the organization. Motivate them to provide support to the rest of the team. On-the-job training for the team members is crucial as they make the transition easy for the employees as they learn the new tool and collaboration techniques. Step 7: Expand and innovate with BIM: Then comes the continuous improvement phase. The aim here is to get more from the BIM strategy. Ask yourself how you can:  Detect issues in construction and structure early and fix them beforehand.  Demonstrate and optimize construction schedules with less material waste.  Deliver projects on schedule and under budget.  Control and streamline communication between all partners with one model.  Manage and maintain facilities post-construction. Each of these advantages will help you construct a better structure and increase profitability. As BIM technology continues to advance and become more dominant, construction organizations know that they must prepare their teams to adapt to these changes. Change is never easy, and a step-by-step guid is the most likely approach to achieve success.

The government allows 100% FDI in areas like infrastructure, SEZs, and industrial parks. In the last 20 or so years, over $17 billion has already been invested through these routes. This being said, global companies want to adopt a more structured and data-driven approach to working. Internationally, new technology such as BIM enhances transparency, creates agility, and fosters innovation. Without these tools in place, international companies assume there may be a lack of predictability and order. Due to this sentiment, many of these companies would appreciate technology like BIM being used to create better plans, more visibility about the progress of projects, and optimize resource procurement and use. It could be said that a new era of structure and transparency is awaited in Indias construction sector. It's already widely known that technology such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a powerful approach that offers many benefits to construction professionals. The adoption of BIM can address the needs of greater predictability, planning, and management. The BIM framework also allows for evaluation processes to occur smoothly as well and provides insights and connectivity for sites too. There is much scope for BIM in enhancing the design, construction, and facility management processes. Despite this, the adoption of this technology in India is still low in the AEC industry. Why is this so? There are many preconceived notions and real-world realities that are causing this slow uptake. Lets discuss 5 such barriers being faced by mid-sized companies in implementing this technology. Cost of Implementation Many contractors feel that the added cost of implementing new technology will be a burden on them. This is due to the idea that the cost of acquisition, deployment and training will be high. To overcome this mindset, companies can learn how to leverage BIM technology to remove process inefficiencies, reduce costs over time, and increase profits. While the technology will demand some upfront investment, the savings that accrue will soon offset that. Its important to change mindsets by creating a feeling of optimism towards the long-term goal. Historically, software has been used to streamline work, manage projects, and predict potential issues way before they occur. All this helps to create a world-class construction in the least amount of time possible. Failing to adopt these technologies can make companies fall behind their competitors  which will prove disastrous in the long run. Interoperability Companies feel that there will be a lack in the ability for the systems to exchange and use information cohesively with the technology and systems they have at present. Its clear that legacy processes will have to change to allow for faster operations, greater transparency, and seamless collaboration and communication. Change always brings concerns that must be allayed. It is also true that construction companies do struggle to attract and retain technology professionals in the face of competition from more glamorous sectors like IT. These issues can be tackled by partnering with specialists to create a carefully planned roll-out of the technology, clear training procedures, and expert advice on process improvements, accompanied by handholding and support. No Change in Mindset of Stakeholders Institutional attitudes towards adapting to new technology, especially in a traditional sector like construction, are always a barrier to development. This includes a bias against adopting new technologies due to prior negative experiences, conservatism, lack of understanding of the tools potential, and a lack of commitment to proper implementation training. Added to this is a reluctance for workers to waste their hours being trained and change their schedule leading to lower than optimal onsite adoption of BIM. To overcome this, all stakeholders must understand how this technology offers the potential to drive improvements in their performance and the impact their teams can deliver. The best way forward is to specifically illustrate to the end-users themselves how this technology will make their workflow easier and more convenient and involve them as they see the change setting in. Clear communication is essential to answering all their doubts and proposing effective solutions to difficult areas. Legal Procedural Challenges Due to a lack of knowledge, there are concerns about the possible legal consequences of using new technology. The reality is that theIndian government is very supportive of adopting BIM. In 2019, studies have shown how this technology can optimise the cost of upcoming and ongoing housing projects in the country. This technology will also help with cutting down on the time escalation of these projects. Niti Aayog was also considering using technologies in multiple government construction projects such as national highway constructions, metro, and airport projects, revamping railways, and more. Iconic projects like the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation are turning to BIM for more efficiency and impact. Its fair to assume that the technology is here to stay. Issues Regarding Cyber Security As with most software, there is always the risk of cybersecurity breaches. People worry about ransomware attacks and data breaches that include project designs, bid information, employee data, materials pricing, financial records, and more. Mitigate this by creating a plan which covers the security of project management software, online collaboration tools, mobile devices, financial apps, and more. Enhanced this by educating employees about cybersecurity measures they can implement to protect data. Also, other strategies such as running contained pilots can help drive familiarity. Introducing BIM as a subject in the university curriculum will help overcome many of these barriers. This would help influence behavior changes and create national-level guidelines. Creating an India-specific BIM product library is also a useful solution. Studies suggestbringing together the Government, industry experts, and academic institutions to create ways to encourage companies to implement the technology. Academics can enhance awareness among students, who will then drive usage and innovation. Industry professionals can conduct training sessions. The Government can further encourage BIM in bids and reports. These steps will maximize the impact of this technology and help streamline many processes related to construction in India.

We have delivered state of the art Building Information Modelling services to architecture, engineering, and construction companies across the world. We are now present in the USA, along with the Middle East and India. It has always been our endeavor to drive ongoing improvement in all the phases of the building lifecycle from planning to execution. Tackling massive scale is not new for us -consider our recent project Maha Metro Rail Corporations Nagpur Metro in India. The city-wide construction had a total length of 40+ km, 36 stations, and 2 depots. While Excelize hasbeen adding immense value to the building industry in Asia, its our work in the USA that gives us special pride. This is the leading economy of the world and projects there have the scale and vision to challenge the best companies. Its gratifying to make a mark and gain the trust of construction majors there. Here are 5 reasons why US companies have faith in us! Putting scale into perspective With over 10 years of experience behind us, addressing scale is not an issue for us. We have been exposed to gigantic projects (like the Nagpur Metro). But perhaps more importantly, for these projects, we have had the good fortune of being involved in providing end-to-end solutions. We have seen every detail of these huge projects and we have found a way to deliver impact. This is why US companies trust us with massive projects. For e.g., we were extremely proud of our solutions for a residential tower project in Florida. This is a skyscraper, 650-feet tall with 60-floors of housing. This high-end complex even included a robotic parking garage providing 284 parking spaces for 132 units allowing unit owners to park cars right outside their unit on each floor. Its fair to say that projects of this scale that rely on advanced technologies such as robotics and IoT are next to impossible to pull off without the precision and insight of BIM modeling. A portfolio without borders (of any kind) We are extremely proud of our international exposure. We have been bringing the best BIM solutions to companies in some of the fastest-growing construction markets of the world. For e.g., we have a significant footprint in the FIFA World Cup-fueled Qatar market. Some of the other international projects undertaken by us were the Greenfield infrastructure project as well as a multi-specialty Hospital in the Middle East and the refurbishment project of a 52-year-Old University Library Building in California. Our portfolio talks loudly and confidently. The exposure is not just to different geographies. Its varied in the kinds of projects we do. The experience required to model a heritage building is very different from the learnings you would take away from a metro project. Its this combination of skills that our US customers value. At Excelize, experience is the best teacher Although this is the norm, we feel that in a field which is ever-evolving and growing on a daily basis, experience is everything. As construction technology changes and the boundaries of what is possible with BIM are being pushed outwards it is critical to have a sound foundation to base your efforts on. Being so hands-on with our projects has taught us many valuable lessons over the years. A decade of working on such large projects has fine-tuned teams to work together. Problem-solving is second-nature to us. The challenges faced on the diverse projects we have worked on have made us this way -a team forged in the fire of rich experience. The proof is in the pudding You have probably seen stats like 83% of the expert BIM users experienced a positive ROI and 93% of the users strongly believed in the potential of gaining more value in the future. (These are according to a McGraw Hill report). Its probably stats like these that have convinced more and more construction projects in the US turn to BIM. Now, sample these stats: - 8% cost saving over projected DPR costs achieved in a $ 1.2 Billion project. - 66% saving of time in creating a Clash Detection and Resolution (CDR) model for a renovation project covering 74,000 sq. ft. - 97% accuracy in predicting the quantity of steel consumed in a residential project of 28 floors. These are actual results delivered by Excelize by leveraging the power of BIM. Its results like these that convince construction companies of our capabilities to add value. Keeping sustainability at the center of modeling It's no secret that green practices are important in the USA. This is especially true after the recent discussions between the American Institute of Architects Committee on the Environment (AIA/COTE) and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The discussion reflects the growing focus on green or sustainable design, which is something that BIM modeling can help with. It is needs like this that are driving the USA construction companies to look to make more investments in Information Technology-driven solutions like BIM. But those investments are not going through, as was reported in Moodys last Global Construction Outlook report. The single biggest reason for the investments faltering was the lack of skilled people. Of course, this is where we come in! Our people have the domain knowledge, they know the best tools like Revit, and they have the exposure and experience that the USA demands. Its a question of being in the right place at the right time. And, as mentioned, we pride ourselves on offering end-to-end solutions. This means our clients don't have to coordinate with numerous vendors. We take over everything- from BIM services,CAD services, construction sequencing services, and even Point Cloud to BIM. This combination seems to be whats making us stand out when USA-based construction companies look for a BIM partner. Is this the combination of skills and experience that you are looking for?

Can BIM help construction projects in extreme or hazardous locations? Did you know that over 100 workers died during the construction of the Hoover Dam? The scale of the effort and the challenging location was found responsible for many of these tragic deaths. Its largely true that the face of the construction industry hasnt changed dramatically since the early 20th century. But small and significant changes have been seeping into every area even as we speak here. Innovation has started infusing everything within the industry from the hardware of our machines to the software being increasingly used. But the construction industry is a dynamic work environment, requires the use of heavy equipment, and carries some inherent risks. Much of construction involved environments that are inherently hazardous. Think bridges, tunnels, oil rigs, and roads across harsh landscapes. These hazards contribute to an unacceptably high injury and illness rate among those who work in construction and this has become one of the major concerns for the industry. Construction companies and contractors have been implementing safety tools and programs to decrease and even prevent work-related hazards on construction sites in hazardous locations. Research has shown that it becomes harder to influence or prevent construction injuries as the project progresses and that the most effective form of safety programme elements occurs at the planning and preconstruction phases of a project. But this post is about another tool that can help with safety on such construction sites located in hazardous environments. That tool is Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM-based software models could be a significant asset when used by design and construction professionals for site layout and safety planning. BIM enables the company to create plans in sequential order alongside a 4D model. Having a 4D BIM model helps visualize the job site and work through various areas and events. It shows where there could be risks and where the weak points are with more accuracy. These can be taken into consideration when putting together the site. That apart, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be used in worker security training, safety planning, job hazard analysis, mishap investigation, and facility and maintenance stage safety. BIM and Improving Site Safety at Hazardous Locations: The attributes of the modern construction business, its projects and site activities are very challenging because of the complicated interchange of numerous partners and organizations. This complicated set up is also a test for site safety management. BIM technology-powered new tools, communication possibilities, and strategies addressing site security aspects can help construction companies advance to a higher-quality of site safety planning. BIM uses include visualization, scope explanation, logistics planning, coordination, collision identification and avoidance, structure approval, construction planning, analysis, virtual mock-ups and what-if scenario visualizations. This information can be tightly integrated with relevant information about the hazards of the location to deliver insights and predictions about what could go wrong. The combination of information can help safety managers and supervisors check safety arrangements across the site in different conditions. Each item can be validated and married to additional information such as the location of safety equipment, areas of storage of potentially hazardous materials, and, even, temporary obstructions created during the ongoing construction. BIM provides safety managers with the ability to perform advanced sequencing and dimensional analysis to track and oversee site logistics and layout. The information can be used to identify potential patterns, problems, and hazards around the site. This could pave the way for coming up with alternate solutions to minimize risk on site. For instance, if a large portion of the structure is created off-site in a restricted environment, this implies fewer risks on the job site. Slips, trips, falls, and other issues can be avoided as the work is being done under controlled conditions on a construction site. This can also lead to lower risk in various risky activities in hazardous conditions. This could also, potentially, reduce the need to store equipment and material on site. Essentially, less work and less material at hazardous locations equals less risk. BIM also allows for better integration of design processes. The outcome is that designers taking advantage of BIM can create and demonstrate design in manners that have been unimaginable in practice until now. These capabilities also facilitate better coordination and collaboration between teams on-location. BIM prevents such errors by enabling dispute detection where the computer model highlights which parts of the structure are wrongly in contact. There are fewer clashes, less need for rework, and fewer occasions to address issues on the fly and under time pressure. This reduced vulnerability and improves the potential for compliance with laid down safety norms. In essence, this is the crux of BIM for improving worker safety in such locations. BIM defines the virtual development of a facility before its actual construction. This allows a risk-free pre-analysis that allows construction companies to reduce vulnerability, improve safety, and simulate and analyse the potential effects of all actions. And that is central to improving safety across construction sites located in hazardous locations.

Craig D. Lounsbrough, Flecks of Gold on a Path of Stone: Simple Truths for Life's Complex Journey Construction is an inevitably sequential process. One thing leads to another. Reversing a previous action is costly, time-consuming, and hard. On the other hand, a well-considered decision can set you on the path to successful project completion with the most optimized investment of effort and resources. So, how can we improve the chances of optimal decisions?   BIM or Building information modeling is already becoming a mainstay of the architecture, engineering, construction and operations industry. But with BIM, a carefully curated building information model can also be utilized for making better decisions about the planning, design, development, and operation of the facility.  Incorporating BIM in construction projects allows the following possibilities:  1. Optimized construction planning: The centralization of data in BIM facilitates quality control early in the project lifecycle. The data updated by all the concerned parties helps in creating a 3D visualization of the final facility. The 3D visualization helps in analysing the practicality of the design  whether the design can be implemented and what is the best way of doing so. Such decisions, when taken at the right time, show an impact over the entire lifecycle of the project.  2. Quantity estimation: One of the most wasteful tasks in a construction project is deriving accurate estimates for the quantity of the required raw material. A construction project can be marred by both over as well as under estimation of the quantity. BIM helps drive much better decisions about the accurate quantity of raw material required. It also allows much better decisions to be made about when these materials would be required. This eliminates waste and allows the project manager to adhere to the projected budget and maintain an efficient logistics schedule. That, in turn, results in avoiding time lags caused due to unavailability of raw material.  3. Better collaboration and communication: BIM technology allows easy collaboration and sharing information in real-time between teams and stakeholders. This ensures that all the team members have access to up-to-date project data at all times, anywhere. The accessibility to accurate data helps in eliminating construction errors during the design phase. The elimination of design error help saves time lags during the construction phase caused due to rework or redesign. Time is an essential resource in a construction project. Any time saved is money saved in terms of labour hours and logistics.  4. Better coordination and early clash detection: The BIM-facilitated seamless coordination between all the concerned parties allows the team managers to identify clashes as the construction proceeds. Such clashes cause rework that brings in delays and wasted effort. Even as such clashes may not be apparent very early in the design phase, even within the short term if teams become aware of impending clashes, they can plan for workarounds and plan the immediate effort much better.  5. Safety and risk mitigation: Construction safety is in focus now. This is even more true when the construction site is in harsh or hazardous locations. BIM gives site managers and others tasked with safety, the most accurate and comprehensive data about the construction facility that allows them to make better decisions about the construction keeping safety in mind. For instance, if the model shows that as the facility takes shape a particular stage could present some specific challenges then the option is available to call for some expert help, deploy technology or add more resources at that point in time.  6. Operations and facilities management: A construction project generates humungous amounts of data which can be very useful for the continuing operation and facility management of the building. The collated data in BIM makes it easier for the facilities manager to make better plans for the ongoing management of the facility. The as-built feature comes handy for driving better decisions during renovation or refurbishment works. The digitally centralized data makes it easier for the operations and facility manager to access information regarding the building, which in turn promotes data-driven decision-making about the smooth functioning of the building during its lifecycle.  The most crucial thing in any project is the ability to make/take efficient decisions at the right time. The efficiency of decision-making in a construction project is mainly dependent upon the availability of data. BIM offers an abundance of accurate and current data about the project in one central location. The accessibility of the information enables accurate decision-making across the project lifecycle, right from planning through the construction and, even, into the maintenance phase.  #BIMForYou - How and why Project Managers should use BIM 7 Ways to control construction project costs  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

Inearlier days, when BIM initially came intouse, people hada misconception that it is suitable only for large complex structures, and most of the early adopters of BIM concentrate on applying this technology to large complex projects. However, now BIM is started to apply widely in residential projects, which brings a significant change in the construction industry. The fact is that BIM for residential design can be adopted effectively for small firms too if we apply it with the right preparation and strategic planning. Selection of the right BIM tool and its implementation through strategic planning of transitioning determines the success of BIM project. This planning is nothing but management. BIM can be defined as the combination of 3Ps, which are process, product, and practice. Here the process is a sum of building information and management, the product is BIM, which is the authoring tool (Revit, Bentley, etc.), and Practices means management that includes strategic planning of transitioning. Experts believe that BIM is suitable for all types of projects of any scale and it can successfully solve the unique complications of each building sector with BIM in residential construction and BIM in residential architecture. That is why, several institutional projects around the world, as well as residential developers, began to accept BIM widely, realizing its benefits. Even though BIM was considered a tool to improve the design process on large projects in earlier times, fortunately, that situation is changed now. The residential owners of this period realize that BIM, beyond a tool, is a method, which can be used throughout the practice for all types of projects of any size and design. As a result, BIM is begun to be used in more and more custom green home projects. THE SEVERAL ADVANTAGEOUS FACTORS OF BIM FOR RESIDENTIAL DESIGN: BIM increases productivity with structured information It improves collective understanding of design intent BIM is capable of analysis and simulation of energy, quantity, and cost It enables better project planning and thereby ensures accuracy It offers cost estimates for early project certainty BIM enhances operations, maintenance, and facility management EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION TOOL BIM enhances the collaborative effort of all members in a construction project including owners, architects, contractors, sub-contractors, engineers, suppliers, trade professionals, and building operations/facilities personnel. So, the right information is accessible in the right place at the right time. Therefore, all projects of any type and size -from complex commercial building structures to small residential projects, get the benefit of BIM. ORGANIZED FLOW OF INFORMATION The main feature of BIM 3D Modeling has a significant role in improving the business and so residential owners and developers depend on visual 3D than 2D. Most of the clients cannot understand the concept flat 2-D world. But developers can convince them easily using 3D models. In short, using Building Information Modeling, we can view the project even before it is built. This technology also helps to avoid miscommunication, frustration, and waste. BIM ENERGY MODELING Increasing energy prices, unpredictable climate change, and occupant health consciousness are matters of high concern around the globe nowadays. the high consumption of energy and carbon emissions worldwide are the threats to our world about which the green evangelists are worried. So, people all over the world are forced to take necessary actions to sustain the society green. As all these phenomena matter to residential, institutional, and commercial building projects, the construction industry is under great pressure for changing the current design and construction approaches. Here comes the importance of BIM. As this new technology helps to reduce the waste and carbon emissions to the atmosphere, several construction firms in US and Canada start to adopt Revit, a BIM-authoring tool in the construction of residential architecture projects and custom green homes. In Canada, using Revit and ArchiCAD, some prefabricated home plants started working. As well pipes are included in prefabricated floor panels using the MEP suite. FUTURE OF BIM As BIM improves the broad-scale project ecosystem and enhances project outputs for all parties, it has growing implications in the construction industry. BIM can satisfy the unique workflow, expectations, and value proposition of each player on a construction project, as it can be applied in every situation. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), the result of BIM application, makes a significant change in the world of the construction industry. We all know that only big enterprises realized the usefulness of computers when it is introduced to the market first. But, now even small children are experts on the computer. Similarly, general contractors and sub-contractors as well as being increasingly using BIM to provide drawings and other disciplines in BIM. Both new projects and renovation projects start to apply BIM for better results.  Benefits and process of Scan to BIM services Ar.

There has been much conversation in recent times about the need for the construction sector to embrace new technologies like the Cloud to improve effectiveness. Collaboration seems to be a focus for everyone. The Construction Cloud promises much in those areas. Of course, Revit has been a key part of our own business operations for years now so we keep a close eye on the innovations emerging from Autodesk. In that context, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at what could change with the Autodesk Construction Cloud. The Construction Cloud is being spoken of as a best-in-class innovation to connect teams, workflows, and information. Its an innovative approach to bringing together a network of professionals and firms, and ground-breaking predictive analytics to enable your business to flourish across all the phases of construction. The construction industry is at a crucial turning point. Organizations no longer want to settle for fragmented teams and disconnected information. This is a great opportunity to break down barriers and build a foundation that supports all the members  from contractors, subcontractors, builders, designers, and owners  through all stages of construction and development, from structure to operations. With the Autodesk Construction Cloud, a new way of working of connected construction and unmatched integration between the office and field teams could begin. Autodesk Construction Cloud is based on the basic principle of:  Design  Plan  Build  Operate At the center of Autodesk Construction Cloud are some proven development solutions:  Assemble  Building Connected  BIM 360  PlanGrid The Construction Cloud incorporates three core components to help construction companies work more effectively and efficiently, collaborate with experts, and get insights that will help then plan and execute, even future projects, better. 1.Advanced Technology:The solutions we know so well. These are built for simple operations that help in aligning organizations, offices, and teams from design through to development and operations. 2.Builders Network:This is an ambitious attempt to build the industrys biggest network of owners, builders, architects, and contractors. The platform could enable these folks to connect with the right partners for the right projects.This is exciting because it could create a kind of thriving marketplace that provides more opportunities for the people with the skills and more functional bandwidth to the people with the need. 3.Predictive Insights:This is a look into the future. Most industries have embraced Big Data and Analytics. The availability of data is not a problem with our business. Now we can leverage that data to get AI-driven analysis that provides the designers and builders with powerful insights to reduce risks by predicting effective outcomes.This can help plan projects better, optimize resource requirements, improve construction safety, and help drive more sustainable practices. The benefit to construction companies is that they can harness the power of the latest in construction technology to connect the entire construction cycle seamlessly. This will help them to create winning strategies to bring more efficiency to projectsby improving project management to control costs and increase profits. At a more granular level, Autodesk Construction Cloud: 1.Promises to help team members collaborate from anywhere. It should enable the easy flow of data from design creation to the job site. 2.Is built with BIM 360s CDE or common data environment. This guarantees that the entire team will collaborate on a coordinated record set. 3.Brings the construction industry a step closer to a unified solution with all our information available on the same platform so that the data is not lost. 4.Makes it easier for field teams to capture videos directly. 5.Could enhanceBIM360 modules. Jenny Moshea, head of technology at Sellen Construction said at the launch, ""Autodesk Construction Cloud brings together advanced technologywhich Autodesk has always been known forwith the network of the building communitywhich is the core of what we do as an industryunderpinned by predictive insights. This is the next evolution, the connected tissue that brings it all together, so the construction lifecycle is no longer disjointed."" The connected tissue of the construction lifecycle -thats a good way to look at a solution that seems to be all about creating efficiencies through connection and collaboration between teams, business entities, and the data our projects produce in such large quantities.  Ace BIM experts will demonstrate these capabilities How is BIM central to construction technology disruption?

It is a smart solution that provides builders, architects, and construction professionals the insight and knowledge to plan, structure, develop and manage their building projects better.BIM does this though a better visual analysis of the structure that facilitates effective decision making with BIM. BIM demands an exceptional understanding of the process of creating and dealing with all of the data points on a project. The digital depiction of each aspect of the structure depends on this precision of data and empowers the meaningful integration of information and technology. Of course, a tool so powerful has some complexities inherent to its application. Building Information Modelling, too, has some modern technical aspects which call for some skills and experience to deliver well. Effective implementation and utilization of BIM technologies and procedures require the attention of BIM professionals. The benefits of hiring an expert BIM Service provider include:  Improved collaboration and control.  Improved project quality.  Faster delivery of projects.  Reduce wastage of resources.  Cost-effectiveness.  Maximum impact from the BIM implementation. With the dramatic rise in the demand for BIM technology around the globe, the demand for individuals with BIM skills has become significant. Putting such a high-impact team together demands serious attention. We do consider ourselves among the top shelf of BIM service providers and from that perspective, perhaps, its worth taking a look at what the best BIM professionals look like. What characteristics set apart the best BIM professionals? Of course, the first requirement is to be an absolute expert on the software tool itself. These professionals must live, breathe, and talk BIM. They must know how to make things happen by harnessing the awesome power of the chosen software tool. But theres more than technical skill involved here. This post is about those other essentials. This isnt a set of guidelines for recruiting, more a set of qualities one must look for in individuals who can best leverage the powerful toolset to provide meaningful data to project teams. As it happens, these also suggest parameters that could be vital in your decision of a trustworthy and skilled BIM solution provider. 1.  Great Communicators:The BIM team plays an essential role in every construction phase involving multiple construction teams. It is important to communicate the information the framework delivers effectively. Consequently, communication is a huge factor in making a capable BIM professional. The ideal BIM professional would be acquainted with the business prerequisites and with the capabilities of the partner teams. Its possible that BIM may be new for the onsite team so when a project executive approaches for something, the team should be able to translate that request into the data that is needed. Team members who can read between the lines and interpret those requirements back again are invaluable. 2.  Flexibility:Different time zones, project types, and plans of action must be considered in the equation. The BIM professional is often required to work offsite and yet be a core part of the onsite team. This suggests the true BIM professional must be flexible to adjust to the necessary business structure, schedules, and procedures. They must also be familiar with a range of requirements and be flexible in their delivery. 3.  Quality-Obsessed:So much depends on the BIM model. The construction planning, that determines how the project goes, is heavily dependent on the model. Equipment schedules, material orders, resource planning, and, even, post-construction facilities management rely on the BIM model. Having a quality driven team makes it possible to get the model right the first time and reduces unnecessary errors and issues. Only if the BIM professional is quality-driven can a strong foundation be built up that will be capable of holding up the entire effort. 4.  Ability to Fuel Innovation:BIM demands a combination of high efficiency and an extreme degree of initiative. This is essential for solving complex issues at the required pace. Individuals with diverse skill sets are key, as different problems need different solutions. A wide variety of ideas and viewpoints are necessary to blend together to come up with the best result. There is a need to look beyond the obvious and see visions of the future that may not be immediately apparent. In such a situation. innovation becomes a stock-in-trade for the folks who craft impactful solutions out of the BIM effort. 5.  Organized:The task is complex and multi-faceted. The stakeholders are many. The desired impact is high. It is also clear that the consumers of the BIM model are varied and what they seek from the model also varies greatly. Staying focused on the task and delivering what is required demands an extreme level of self-organization. Such an organized approach makes it easy to monitor tasks, deadlines, and priorities and deliver what everyone needs. BIM is a solution that includes team-members and consumers of information from several unique backgrounds which include builders, architects, engineers, contractors, and so on. A BIM professional who can deliver what each of these stakeholders requires has a special set of skills. The professionals who work on our team share the traits listed here.

Ongoing projects were stalled due to the nationwide lockdown. As the situation developed, many workers returned to their hometowns as they feared for their safety and livelihood. As lockdowns lift slowly, the ramifications are still becoming clear. By some estimates,12.2 crorespeople may have lost their jobs, a huge section of which hail from the construction sector, one of the biggest job creators in the market. The good news is, the lockdown is being lifted in many parts of the country in a phased manner. With stimulus packages announced and government spending ramping up, economic activity will also look to kick on. The hope is that the industry will regain its workforce and informal labour. According to a report by theEconomic Times, 70% of highway projects have already been resumed in Delhi, and metro projects too are being opened in various parts of the country like Pune, Chennai, Kanpur, Delhi, and Kolkata. That said, due to labour shortage, material unavailability, and transportation issues, it could take a while before all the projects are back on track. Here are some suggestions to restore the pace of development across Indias ambitious metro projects. Take lessons from the past We should take effective lessons from the success of previous projects to ensure that the work is completed on time and without much hassle. For example, theNagpur Metro constructionproject was one of the fastest-completed projects in the history of the nation. With proper incorporation of advanced technologies like BIM and well-planned utilization of sustainable energy sources, the project is referred to as the greenest metro in India, apart from being acknowledged for its pace and efficiency. According to a report byNation Next, the project took only 27 months from the date of inception to the completion of trial runs, which is a record in itself. Great leadership, proper communication between all the stakeholders, and constant tracking and monitoring led to the success of the Nagpur Metro project. We should refer to such shining examples to deal with future projects, especially during such difficult times. Ensure proper hygiene With the lockdown getting lifted, we need to be careful about the safety of the workers on site. This is both a moral and strategic imperative. Any spread of infection will impact not only the health of the workers but could also shut down or quarantine the site. We MUST take all necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of the workers. Soaps, sanitizers, masks, and face shields should be provided to the workers, especially if their work involves meeting other people and working alongside them. Apart from supplying masks and sanitizers, we could go the extra mile to provide proper food, sanitation, and hygienic working conditions to the workers to prevent them from falling sick. Social distancing, no matter how difficult it may seem, should be maintained at all costs while working. The companies must take the time to create awareness through education among all the workers regarding the precautionary measures that each worker needs to take to stay safe. Technology integration is a must The success of the Nagpur Metro project can be attributed to the integration of technologies like 5D BIM, which enhanced the resource efficiency, speed, and overall quality of the project. The clash-detection capabilities of BIM can become a massive contributor to saving time in such large and complex projects. In ongoing and future projects, the developers should make the most of such technologies like 3D visualizations, 4D progress monitoring, BIM modeling services to ensure successful completion within the deadlines. Integrating mobile apps into the operating processes will help increase the accessibility to plans and information on and off-site. With more incorporation of high-end technologies on the construction site, the load on the engineers could be lessened, thus helping them increase their focus on providing innovative suggestions and solutions to solve pressing problems. Technology will also ensure seamless communication and the minimum loss of information, besides helping in mitigating potential risks. Focus on post-construction evaluation At the end of each phase of the project, a proper evaluation model could be put in place to identify potential issues to learn from. This will allow us to take necessary corrective actions in time for future phases. For instance, accurate and complete as-built BIM models can give the engineers valuable insight into the various components of the project. You could break down the model into phases and look at them in the context of engineering design, construction, and evaluation to get insights for improvements. Stay in sync with the rules There are a bunch of rules defined by the government. It would be useful to turn to some intelligent system to track the rules as well as log compliance with those rules. Its a dynamic situation and regulations change, so its important to stay on top of the rules defined by the Government of India but also the SOPs that come into play in todays construction site. For eg., it may be best if the workers are prevented from using public transport to reduce their exposure to infections. The company can arrange for proper transportation facilities for the workers, who will also be keener to resume work if they feel safe. All the extra efforts that we take now will count in the long run. The faster you can complete the projects that you are working on, the better for your cash flows and overall financial results. The builders, developers, and construction companies that pull through this extremely challenging period will be extremely well placed to overcome any challenge in the future. After all, what could be harder than the situation we are in currently?

As much as the feeling is that the industry resists change, it has evolved steadily and constantly. Who could have thought that we could not only identify clashes but also rectify them before the construction began or that construction doesnt need to happen at the construction site? It would have been hard to imagine a few years ago. But, here we are, and this is just the beginning of how technology is going to revolutionize the way we think and do things in our industry. The ever-increasing infrastructure demands, and tight spaces on-site have opened the gates to offsite construction. As perone definition, Offsite construction is the completion of elements or components of a construction project at a different location from where they will be permanently installed. The offsite construction involves planning, design, and fabrication of the elements which are then built in the offsite manufacturing unit. The manufacturing unit can either be a permanent facility or a temporary facility built for the duration of a project.The finished product is then transported to the construction site for installation. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention  the global construction industry is looking towards new and innovative ways to keep projects moving faster and more efficiently. And, offsite construction is just one of them. And, I feel this change has been long overdue in the industry. 3D Printing and Offsite Construction  What are they? The current pandemic situation has made the world turn around to technology to innovate and fight against the COVID19 breakout. 3D printing found global attention when the medical fraternity turned towards it to meet the shortage in supply for masks and other equipment. But, did you know that the construction industry has been using 3D printing to revolutionize the construction methods and techniques for long? Researchers have been toying with the idea of 3D printing since the early 80s. It took three decades for 3D printing technology to become mainstream but, it started becoming mainstream only recently. 3D printing is a combination of techniques that are used to print a physical structure. The three-dimensional physical structure is created from a digital file in 3D modeling software which is then brought to life via a 3D printer. The technology is relatively new for the construction industry. It is rapidly being developed and innovated to build complete structures like bridges and houses using materials such as concrete, metal, and resin.You would have all seen fascinating videos of homes being built in, what seems like, hours. Thats 3D printing at work. Understanding the role of BIM in 3D Printing and Offsite Construction In this technological age, people have certain expectations and demands like speed, accuracy, and an elevated user experience that cannot be fulfilled with traditional construction methods. I believe thatBIM technologyis reshaping the digital landscape of the construction industry while offsite construction and 3D printing are set to reshape the physical landscape. And the two are deeply connected. The nature of the beast is such that you have to follow JIT methods. That leaves little flexibility in offsite construction schedules or onsite assembly or installation. To make offsite construction work you need extremely comprehensive, accurate, and current data about the site as it stands. That becomes the base for the elements that get constructed offsite. You cannot afford any gaps or deviations as that will make assembling the elements onsite incredibly difficult, if not impossible. That is whereBIM modelscan deliver massive value. Its remarkably similar with 3D printing. The structure comes up based on a detailed and comprehensive digital depiction. Theres truly little room for manual intervention or on the fly changes. This is a made for BIM use-case. The benefits of 7-dimensional BIM have been well-established in our industry. Now its time to realize the potential of BIM in backing innovations like 3D printing and offsite construction. The construction industry is at a cusp of a technological revolution with BIM, offsite construction, and 3D printing playing a crucial role in it. The future is digital. Considering the acceleration in the pace of life there is likely to be increasing pressure on construction companies to complete structures within a very short period. In essence, the construction industry will have to depend upon technologies like these to deliver better, faster, greener, and sustainable structures. Its certain that BIM will play a key enabling role in all these developments!  7 Ways to control construction project costs BIM For Conceptual Estimating  About Excelize About Excelize Careers CSR Global Locations USA : California USA : New Jersey Qatar : Doha INDIA : Aurangabad Our Services BIM Services BIM Solutions BIM Consulting CAD Services Follow Us On Resources BIM Standards White Papers Case Studies News & Updates Segments General Contractors Design Build Contractors Engineering Firms Architects Real Estate Developers Latest Blogs Benefits of BIM: Empowering Sustainability in the AEC IndustryA Guide on OpenBIM for the AEC IndustryThe AI-BIM Revolution: Analyzing the Benefits and the Future of Construction Flagship Projects International Airport Terminal Metro Rail School Convention Centre Copyright  2022 Excelize All Rights Reserved. | Privacy Policy function callus(){$(""#callusformError"").html("""");var e=$.trim($(""#pname"").val()),r=$.trim($(""#pcomment"").val()),t=$.trim($(""#pemail"").val()),a=$.trim($(""#penq"").val()),l=$.trim($(""#purl"").val()),o=$.trim($(""#psource"").val()),m=""true"";return""""===e?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Name Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):""""===t?($(""#callusformError"").append('<span style=""color:red;""> Email Must Not Be Empty.</span>'),m=""false""):($(""#callusformError"").html(),m=""true""),""true""==m&&($("".become-partner"").removeClass(""quick-contactActive""),document.getElementById(""pname"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pcomment"").value="""",document.getElementById(""pemail"").value="""",$.ajax({type:""POST"",url:l,beforeSend:function(){$(""#formloader"").show(),$(""#callUSBtn"").attr(""disabled"",""disabled"")},data:{name:e,comment:r,email:t,source:o,enq:a},success:function(e){$(""#formloader"").hide(),$(""#getQuoteModal"").modal(""hide""),window.location.href=""/thank-you""},error:function(e){}})),!1}"

COVID-19 has created a situation wherethe demand is for India to be self-reliant in every way with the extensive support of science and technology. For sectors in India such as construction, there couldnt be a better time to revamp the processes and fine-tune technology adoption as the projects reopen gradually. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recommended self-reliance as the way forward and suggested five pillars of self-reliance. These were economy, infrastructure, technology-driven systems, vibrant demography, and demand. Of those, at least two, infrastructure and technology-driven systems, go hand in hand. Lets see how this match is necessary now. Indias construction industry: A recap Earlier this year, at the Construction Technology Conference in India, the Prime Minister had stated that the year 2020 was going to be all about construction and technology. Indias construction industry is already one of the fastest-growing in the world and was expected to reach$ 1 trillion by 2025. A variety of challenges face Indias construction sector but the industry has been growing exponentially. Despite that, the use of technology has still not picked up enough space. The construction sector in India is often disorganized, family-run, and labour-dependant. The developers are still inclined to rely on conventional methodologies and practices. The wide availability of cheap manual labor and the necessity to keep the construction costs lower are some of the reasons why the construction industry in India is averse to adopting technology. Indias construction industry is largely driven by homebuyers. The demand for residential properties has been steadily increasing and theres a significant pressure to maintain a low cost of construction as the property prices continue soaring due to several other factors. The cost of land is one and commercial practices is another. The government has been actively engaged in introducing the global best practices and the RERA Act and GST are some efforts to standardize projects, assureconsumers of definite timelines in project delivery, and regulating the industry in general. The Impact of COVID-19 In late March 2020, the country went into complete lockdown, shutting down all the construction projects- public as well as private. This had the knock-on effect ofdriving a large displacement of thousands of construction laborers, causing them to return home. This has also jeopardized the future of several projects. When the lockdown is lifted, there are high chances that things wont be back to normal fairly quickly for the construction industry. The shortage of raw material, as well as manpower, is expected to cause several hurdles in the projects across the country, bringing to the fore the importance of modernizing the construction processes by using technology. The need will be to deliver projects faster with constrained resources and fewer staff on site. Thats a made for technology problem. For instance, turning to Building Information Modeling could help constriction companies optimize resource estimates, make better plans and schedules, ensure greater collaboration, reduce clashes, and detect issues early. This has been proven to help deliver projects faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost.  Lack of standardization: The wake-up call One of the most critical reasons causing problems in the construction process in the country and also causing significant delays in project completion is the lack of standardization. The industry mostly depends on decentralized processes and theres no modern project management to keep an active track of completion status and identifying the roadblocks. Along with causing delays in the project delays, this also results in budget overruns for the project. In post-COVID-19 times, such scenarios can be risky for developers in the industry. And there couldnt be a better time to adopt technology like Building Information Modelling or BIM. Implementing BIM not only helps in accelerating the design, planning, and visualization process but also helps in controlling the construction project costs, which is paramount especially post COVID-19. Smart devices and IoT-based sensors along with project management software could also be immensely helpful in tracking project progress in real-time. Smart cities: Indias hot target India is already gearing up for a paradigm shift and bridging the infrastructural gap has been on the checklist of the government while also being a demand from the citizens of the country. The National Smart Cities Mission has been one of such endeavors to remodel the existing urban areas with immaculate planning. Optimizing land, creating enough open spaces and walkable localities, developing new public transport such as metros, and applying smart solutions for infrastructural developments are few of the many agendas of the smart cities mission. As the world struggles post-COVID-19, India has a great opportunity to shine and smart cities powered and accomplished with technology can help in doing so. These projects could be quick to dive into, given that they are already at various stages of planning and execution already. Achieving these monumental benchmarks in the stipulated time will only be possible with the help of technology. The rapidly growing importance of green construction The modern Indian consumer is more energy conscious than before and from office spaces to residential blocks, the demand for green construction is higher than ever. Construction using environment-friendly material, energy-efficient buildings with recycling mechanisms in place and IoT-powered smart buildings are gaining momentum, especially in the metro cities. For the sustainable approach to construction, it is imperative to look for modern solutions that involve technology for efficient energy usage, reduced wastage, and sustainable operation and maintenance. And, no surprise that BIM has a role to play here. The construction industry in India pre-COVID approached technology with a dont fix something that isnt broken approach. But times have changed. To thrive and survive, the construction industry must implement new technologies, and now is the time to put global best practices into action.

The construction industry is no exception. Ever since its introduction and especially over the last few years, BIM Technology has transformed the way the construction industry operates. Many countries like the UK have made the use of BIM mandatory for large-scale public projects. The impact of BIM drives optimum utilization of the resources as well as greater productivity and profitability. The Indian construction industry is catching up with the utilization of BIM technology, but it has its fair share of challenges. Mr. CB Amarnath, Founder, India BIM Association has this to say, We have about 30-40K people who are using BIM for projects, but most of the people providing these services are for the global markets, there are a very few who are providing the services for Indian projects largely because they are not able to convince clients about the benefits of BIM. When we talk about the level of development, its mainly for modeling, scheduling, estimation, and not for construction tracking or FM usage, etc. There is a need for providing information about how this can be adopted for various stages of projects. BIM Adoption Challenges in India BIM has been around for nearly two decades but has recently become more mainstream in the professional consciousness. The adoption of BIM technology has been slower than expected in India due to some inherent challenges. Here are some significant hurdles that BIM adoption in the Indian construction industry faces: 1. Lack of Expertise The biggest challenge faced by the construction industry for BIM adoption is the lack of widespread expertise. Some organizations (like Excelize) do provide specialized BIM services. But its fair to say that the majority of Indias construction companies do not have many employees who are qualified or knowledgeable enough to integrate BIM and construction projects seamlessly. The lack of in-house expertise results in BIM experiments. Projects suffer from inefficiency and loss of profits due to increased operating costs. This creates the perception that the technology is hard to adopt. 2. Lack of Awareness The second most significant hurdle is the lack of awareness regarding BIM technology. In a country as vast as India, theres no dearth of construction projects  both public and private. But it is still true that a significant part of the real estate industry is not attuned to the most modern construction practices. There is a lack of awareness of the implementation of BIM and the potential benefits. This translates into a lack of management support or sponsorship, without which no strategic initiative can become successful. 3. Cost-effectiveness for small projects BIM has more than proved its mettle in big projects by saving humungous amounts of money by reducing operating and inventory costs. However, this cannot always be said for smaller projects. These projects lend themselves easily to more intuitive and experience-driven decision making. The penalty for mistakes is also smaller as are the budgets. This makes it less attractive to implement BIM with its operating costs and effort commitments. Hiring experts and training the existing workforce involves significant investments. The small and medium size construction companies see this as an expense rather than an investment as they are less likely to see the long-term benefits of investing in BIM services. 4. Resistance to change A growing fraction of construction companies have adopted BIM for their construction projects. But implementing BIM also necessitates a change in the operations of the construction company. Better planning means greater responsibility for perfect execution. There is less room for error and hence greater pressure to perform. All these factors contribute to resistance to adopt technological change. Companies that worry about the cultural impact prefer to operate traditionally instead of investing in training the existing workforce or hiring a new workforce that is more in tune with the BIM-driven approach. 5. Lack of cooperation between stakeholders The most significant advantage of BIM technology is the integration of the workflow of all the involved stakeholders. Now, this involves high levels of collaboration from the interested parties. This is a significant challenge that only becomes greater as the project becomes bigger. Large infrastructure projects have multiple teams associated with specific point responsibilities. Quite often the involved parties lack the will to cooperate. Conflicts arising due to noncooperation between the stakeholders make it difficult to carry out work -BIM-led or not. Successful BIM adoption demands a level of expertise within the organization. It mandates a change in the organizations way of working. The cost and effort of leveraging BIM have restricted its impact to the larger, more visionary companies and projects. That said, this is the direction the world is moving in and India has to catch up. Its time for Indias construction industry to get BIM power.

Under those circumstances, there is a lot of pressure on contractors and designers to find more effective ways to reduce construction costs. BIM is being used by a growing number of engineers, architects, and contractors to make the design and development of structures faster, better, and more cost-efficient. BIM has been proven to help reduce costs and increase efficiency throughout the project lifecycle ranging from design and construction to facility management. BIM helps the construction company to save money in the design and construction and development phases of the project. Here are some of the ways how BIM can help lower the lifetime cost of a building:  BIM helps to improve collaboration:Failing to collaborate on projects leads to time delays and increases the cost beyond the initial estimations. BIM helps to enhance collaboration on the projects. This integrated nature of BIM helps to improve productivity within the engineering team and opens up new channels of communication, which makes it easy for the team members to work effectively with others involved with the projects. With BIM, teams come together on a common platform to ensure everyone can play their part. Accessible communication and effective collaboration are some of the main reasons to implement BIM for effective outcomes.  BIM saves time (and cost):In the construction business, time and cost are essential factors in the project life cycle. One of the main reasons for organizations to adopt BIM is the potential for savings on cost and time. BIM helps to reduce both these elements of the project and improve the efficiency of the project lifecycle. With BIM, organizations can not only unleash creativity and enhance collaboration, but also save time and reduce the costs of the project. BIM helps to plan for the projects based on factors like cost and labor. It also helps discover unexpected expenses and helps the construction company deal with unplanned time constraints.  Helps to improve coordination and clash detection:BIM permits teams to coordinate better and detect any internal, or external clashes before the construction cycle begins. BIM helps to avoid such conflicts with automated clash detection. This helps to reduce the amount of rework required during the construction phase. BIM provides the opportunity to plan it right before the onsite construction begins. It also helps to avoid last-minute changes and any unforeseen issues. Rework is time and effort-intensive, both of which cost money.  BIM enables prefabrication:BIM provides easy storage and access to a wealth of information. This, in turn, helps the construction company leverage innovative means to save money. For instance, this information helps to generate detailed drawings for offsite manufacturing purposes. BIM makes it easy to design, detail, and build structures in an offsite controlled environment, thus increasing efficiency and reducing waste, labor, and material costs.  BIM helps to create safer construction sites:BIM helps to improve the safety of construction sites by pinpointing the hazards at the initial stages of the designing phase before they become problems. This enables the organization to mitigate physical risks by visualizing and planning onsite activities better. The safety and visual risk analysis evaluations with BIM helps to ensure safety throughout the project lifecycle. A safer workplace is a more productive workplace. Safety on the construction site is also a proven way to avoid expenses due to accidents and delays.  Reduces construction changes and design rework:During the design phase, BIM helps to reduce the errors and the redesign cost drastically. With BIM, the central model can be changed, which is then reflected in all associated drawings. By identifying potential issues and conflicts in the design phase itself, organizations can work productively and rework on the construction design problem to reduce errors. This helps to build structures without the need to redo things and eliminate the cost associated with changes late in the cycle. BIM frameworks also allow designers to observe the impact of any design changes instantly and factor those into the build as well as plan for their development.  BIM provides a model-based cost estimation:BIM allows for an effective construction cost estimation, earlier in the planning stage. BIM helps to automate the time-consuming task of applying and quantifying costs, which enables organizations to focus on other value factors, such as identifying and factoring the risks. The BIM models enable better resource and material estimates. This means that materials can be procured in just the right quantity at just the right time. This has a big impact on reducing material wastage and costs associated with onsite storage of materials including material loss and pilferage. There is also the impact on financing costs as funds have to be committed only when they are needed and not earlier. All this helps control costs. Theres no doubt that BIM or Building Information Modeling has become an essential tool with an abundance of advantages for the construction industry. As this post shows, projects using BIM have the opportunity to control construction costs too by leveraging this powerful technology.

Sonali Dhopte at Smart Buildings Summit 2015 Ar. Sonali Dhopte at Smart Buildings Summit 2015 Buildings today are complex concatenations of structures, systems, and technology. Over time, each of the components inside a building has been developed and improved, allowing modern-day building owners to select its features independently. Smart buildings go well beyond just using smart materials and protocols. So, what exactly are these? A smart building uses information technology to connect a variety of subsystems, which typically operate independently, so these systems can share information to optimize total building performance. Enabled by technology, this smart building connects the structure itself to the functions it exists. That said, smart buildings look beyond the building equipment within their four walls. The Smart Buildings Summit got underway in Hotel Four Seasons, Mumbai, on August 21, 2015. Organized by CONSTRUCTION WORLD and Smart Cities Council India, the summits theme was Smart Buildings: Redefining Our Buildingswith the involvement of12 speakers and 5 high-powered sessions. Mr. Padode, as moderator, touched upon building automation, which already exists, but which has a cost involved, delving deeper intobuilding information modeling(BIM), building maintenance system (BMS), and geographic information system (GIS). Other panelists includedarchitect Sanjay Puri,Chetan Raikar, Chairman, and Managing Director, Structural Consultants,andSonali Dhopte, Director, Excelize. Topics in Smart Building Technology Smart elements to optimize overall building performance Future of building automation Innovative technologies for smart and optimal utilization of water and waste Technological advances to predict and address failures Remote monitoring and management  During this panel discussion, the need for using Smart Building Technology was discussed. Using BIM during the design phase for coordination and then using the data from this model during the operation stage of a building is one of the ways the buildings can be made smarter. This was discussed by the panel in relation to the solar analysis and temperature control in any building, water meters, recycling water, and using innovative construction techniques to make buildings smarter.

The important one among them is Scan to BIM. We can see the application of Scan to BIM process extensively in renovation projects. Here data is derived with the help of laser scanning technology and later productive3D BIM modelsare developed using these data. As-built data deprived of 3D laser scanning captured with the help of laser scanning equipment assist ingenerating accurate 3D BIM models fasteras compared to the traditional methods. External and internal laser scanning helps to build accurate 3D surveys further assisting in creating intelligent 3D models. BENEFITS OF 3D SCAN TO BIM: Scan to BIM helps in improved transparency, communication, and collaboration. BIM model generated from the scan data allows more reliability & quality assurance Reduces the construction cost Scan to BIM eases project alterations and assists in faster decision making Using BIM throughout the building process leads to better sustainability in the project The virtual creation of BIM model from scan data helps eliminate costly mistakes during construction Building data are extracted during the scanning process using highly effective laser scanners. When laser beams get back the hardware and they were directed towards the structure, in the beginning, points clouds are acquired. SCAN TO BIM WORKFLOW: Modelers should open Revit first to include point cloud data in Revit project Once the modelers get accessible to Revit, converting the available scanned data into effective file formats is the next procedure. BIM Modelers are generally covert raw scanned data into point cloud files using Autodesk ReCap. Models should transform raw scanned data into appropriate cloud files during the indexing process. After the indexing process, the raw scanned data is transformed into .rcp and .rcs file formats. So, users can link the point cloud files within a Revit project soon after they get .rcp and .rcs file formats. Countless .rcs files (Reality Capture Scan files) are included in an .rcp file (Reality Capture Project File). So, cloud files modelers should click Insert tab first and then Link Panel. After that, they can select Point cloud icon within Link panel. After selecting Point cloud, the modelers have to identify the files which should be linked to the project. BIM modelers are allowed to pick either a .rcp extension file or a .rcs extension file, depending on their requirement. BIM Models should use Point Cloud tool in order to insert the file into Revit Project. Once the modelers select a suitable file, then they have to focus on how to position a file in the project. Modelers can position a file in the project either by selecting Auto-center to center option or by using an option among Auto  Origin to Origin, Auto  Origin to Last Placed, and Auto By Shared Coordinates. Once the modelers choose an effective file positioning option, then they can link the point cloud file in the project by clicking on open. If the modelers follow the above-described steps effectively, they can easily and efficiently link thepoint cloud files into Revit Project. With BIM implementation the fundamental techniques of operation in the construction industry are rapidly changing. It is believed that BIMs feature of openly sharing information would derive substantial benefits in cost and value proposition. Renovation or refurbishment BIM projects could be more accurately and comprehensively completed with the help ofScan to BIM method of capturing 3D survey data.

While the real estate sector in India was the domain area of only a handful of players in the 90s, now its growth has reached investors, developers, and global stakeholders in the growing construction industry in the country. The second-largest employment sector in India, after agriculture, is real estate. Besides generating a high level of direct employment, it also increases the demand for ancillary industries like paint, brick, steel, building materials, consumer durables, etc. NRIs get an exciting opportunity for investment in real estate with the constant depreciation of the Indian rupee.As the Indian rupee is falling, more Gulf-based non-resident Indians (NRIs) start to invest in the real estate market, as it ensures relatively higher returns. CHALLENGES OF INDIAN REAL ESTATE SECTOR The mainchallenges faced by Indian building industryare significant schedule and cost overrun, which is mainly occurring due to wastage of material, poor coordination, significant rework, and lack of information sharing. Let us point out the main issues faced by firms involved in the built environment as follows. Changes in design Time, and work affect consumption Higher possibilities for error and rework Increasing input costs Deficiency of skilled labor results in high risks for workers Construction cost estimations Anxieties about the quality and productivity of the project Lack of organization in the market Rare virtual environment work INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN REAL ESTATE SECTOR The bigger challenges faced by Real estate sector can be solved up to a limit with the emergence of technologies likeBIM models. A lot of different IT-enabled project management tools have been introduced in the real estate market and the industry can ensure more efficient project delivery with the help of these technological tools. Such technologies can act as a catalyst to change the real estate companies in India and redefine their space in the country for both now and in the future. They can make tremendous changes in all areas of construction, project management, business management, marketing, customer service, etc. How BIM modeling benefits to real estate industry BETTER OUTPUT THROUGH BIM COLLABORATION BIM creates a collaborative working relationship among all project partners including various design disciplines, contractors, specialists, suppliers, and customers, using a single shared 3D model. As a result, everybody involved in the project will focus on achieving the best value throughout the project from project inception to eventual decommissioning. OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE As a swift and accurate comparison between various design options is possible with BIM, it can develop more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective solutions. ENHANCED SOLUTIONS The deployment of new generative modeling technologies enabled cost-effective solutions against agreed parameters. BETTER FORECAST Using BIM, the project team canbuild the project in a virtual environmentbefore construction started. This virtual model rehearses complex procedures, optimizes temporary works, and plans the procurement of materials, manpower, and equipment. As BIM can provide the owners and operators with a visual representation of the project at an early stage, they get a clear idea about the design intent. So they can suggest modifications in the design to get the output they really want. QUICK PROJECT TURNAROUND As BIM allows changes in design concept in the early stage of the project, last time design changes can be avoided. Similarly, it uses standard design elements and so complex construction details can be solved before the project starts. Moreover, itproduces fabrication and construction drawings from the model, uses data to control construction equipment and checks design integrity, and estimates quantities. All these features of BIM will help the construction industry to save time by up to 50%. ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES The designs using BIM can optimize public safety with the help of crowd behaviors and fire modeling capability. Asset managers can enhance operational safety using the 3D model. Contractors can also review complex details or procedures before the project starts and it avoids construction risks. ELIMINATION OF ERRORS AT EARLY DESIGN STAGE The single 3D model can integrate multidisciplinary design inputs that enable to identify and resolve interface issues prior to construction. It eliminates chances of redesign and saves time and costs. Using this model we can also integrate existing and new assets seamlessly. REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BROUGHT BY BIM IN CONSTRUCTION The fundamental changes brought byBIM can rapidly transform the real estate and construction industryin India. For centuries our construction industry represents and communicates design intent for client approval, procurement, bidding, fabrication, installation, construction, etc. by using the traditional method of symbols on paper, which includes drawings and specifications. But these abstractions lack native intelligence in them and so they need human interpretation and manipulation to provide meaning and value.

Maha-Metro Corporation decided to make use of 5D BIM processes to have an integrated environment for all the BIM data along with the project schedules and costs. Overview of 5D BIM system Architecture: The Nagpur Metro 5D BIM system had the 3D models and the related data at its core on a common data environment euphemistically called Electronic Data Management System (EDMS). The model data was linked to the project schedules on a Prima Vera server and costs data on the SAP ERP system. Excelizes expertise on the BIM models, and various software for BIM resulted in Excelize being trusted with the EDMS part of the 5D BIM system. The EDMS comprised of Bentley systems Project Wise and Asset Wise software. Excelize devoted its expertise to formulating modeling guidelines, the configuration of the Bentley software, installation of the client application on user machines, license control, and training on the use of the software. Excelize had been in consultation with the owner (Maha Metro) and their technical consultants (called General Consultants or GC); formulated the information and workflow processes and configured them on the system. Excelize formed the part of the Owners Support Office (OSO) that gave necessary support to the owner to effectively use the system. This included the training of Owner / GC and Contractor personnel, coordination with Bentley, and other 5D BIM vendors, and system administration for the Asset wise and Project wise systems. The administration part included the user configuration, contract configuration, and creation of the box reports as well as custom dashboards. Excelize helped the GC personnel in the review of models on the system by helping them to ensure that the models meet the necessary guidelines, federate different models from different sources on the Project Wise system, and derive different outputs required by the owner. Asset Management: One of the core features of the 5D BIM system is an integrated asset management system. Excelize engineers interacted extensively with the different disciplines of the Metro Rail project such as Stations, Via-ducts, Rolling stocks, Tracks, Signalling, Telecom, OHE, Security systems, etc. With the deep consultations from Excelize, the asset strategy, asset tagging system, and the workflows for asset management for the life cycle of the assets were formulated. The workflows and asset tag structures were mapped on the system so that the contractors and GC were able to connect the asset tag to the model entity and all the technical documents such as drawings, operation manuals, inspection reports, etc were tied to an asset tag. Excelizes core architectural and construction modeling and the industry experience have come in handy for Maha Metro corporation for the Nagpur Metro Rail Project to successfully implement the 5D BIM systems EDMS. It also resulted in Excelize being further mature in its knowledge of greenfield project implementation as well as exposure to different systems that form a large infrastructure project. Excelize will build on this to provide the benefit of this combined knowledge of 3D BIM modeling along with EDMS, 5D BIM systems,s, and industry practices in various disciplines. Excelize would attempt to garner more business in this area and supplement its leadership position.

Some Benefits of BIM Implementation in Construction: Better Visualization of the Project Designing a Customized Team Workflow Acting as a Guide to Project Participants, Eliminating Risks Improved Collaboration amongst Project Stakeholders BIM Implementation must be done through a structured approach. It involves, people, process and technology integration and cannot be done randomly. Phases of BIM Implementation: Evaluation or Assessment phase Project Pre-Planning, pilot, and testing phase Execution at the Design & Construction phases Operations & Maintenance phase integration BIM implementation plans must be customized to meet any organizations BIM maturity level. BIM consultants ensure that your organization moves smoothly through all the stages of BIM implementation. Assessing BIM capability: The first step involves measuring current BIM maturity of organizing and the team involved and aligning that with the BIM goals for the project or organization. Monitoring is a continuous process scheduled at all stages of decision making, documentation, strategizing and implementation. Evaluating the knowledge acquired by individual members and learning collaboratively for enabling the organization to be self-sufficient is a major goal at this stage. Setting up project goals: Setting up both intermediate as well as long term BIM goals for the organization helps with a structured implementation approach. It is essential to finalize and document it after in-depth discussion through analyzing objectives & utility requirements for implementation and considering industry-specific expectations. Defining strategies: BIM standards, process and methodologies facilitate in measuring progress and target milestones. Streamlining existing practices as well as replacing or modifying those in the desired direction for achieving BIM goals through a solid BIM Implementation Plan (BIP) in the key at this stage. Shaping the processes: Based on the analysis and defining strategies, the process is shaped by replacing or upgrading tools, technologies, and skills of resources. After discussions a comprehensive BIM implementation budget is finalized, processes are tested, monitored, and refined to specific requirements. Practical training on BIM projects  Based on the goals of the organization, training is very essential and must be provided to the resources. The training process involves BIM awareness, updating software training & relevant skill sets along with training given on BIM practices for communication, file sharing and file naming. Executing live project - This is the final phase, where the execution team is deployed, defining the roles & responsibilities of the team members.

International airport terminal Project Area:480,000M2 What we did:Our scope of work essentially comprised of building a BIM model, to include clash detection and resolution, and vital coordination between the architectural, structural and services (MEPF) teams. For this, we leveraged our team of on-site as well as off-site coordinators and modelers, to create the resolutions of the model and build the model at LOD 300, respectively. Metro rail Project Area:18 Miles, with a total of 38 stations What we did:We were the 5D BIM consultants on this prestigious project and worked alongside consortium partners to facilitate 3D modeling, clash detection and conflict resolution. Leveraging the Bentley platform, namely AssetWise, ProjectWise and RIB iTWO, we created models, project schedules, construction sequencing and what-if scenarios. School Project Area:270,000 Sq. ft. What we did:For this high school building, we generated a BIM model at LOD 300, to consider the architectural and structural elements involved. We also worked on the exterior elevation details and materials, in addition to the site landscape and site elements. We created the BIM model from the input Point Cloud Data.
